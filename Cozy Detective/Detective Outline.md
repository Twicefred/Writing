## Characters

**Detective** - Switch</br>
Species: Human</br>
Name: Rob "Raunchy" Rizzolini


**Estate Agent** - Murder victim</br>
Species: Raccoon</br>
Name: Levi Lawson</br>
Levi was Maximilian's manager and estate agent. He got into this position by virtue of his father's relationship to Max. While he does modernise and skilfully manage the estate, he has been embezzling funds for his own personal gain.


**Aristocrat**</br>
Species: Lion</br>
Name: Marquis Maximilian Morganstein
The Aristocrat is the only main character (other than the murder victim) who doesn't figure in a sex scene.</br>


**Fitness Instructor** - Top</br>
Species: Bull</br>
Name: Sebastian Souder</br>
Sebastian is a recent hire, having arrived at the estate only three month's past. This makes it relatively unlikely that he'd be the murderer, however he is hot-headed and several other staff members report having witnessed him and the victim argue.</br>
Sebastian isn't the first PT employed at the mansion. His predecessor left when he realised that Maximilian had no intention of following his advice.</br>
Sebastian has no direct motive for murder, but is initially questioned because of his temper and history of fighting with the other staff.


**Head Cook** - Top</br>
Species: Bear</br>
Name: Claude Champignon</br>
Claude isn't actually French. He adopted a new name and accent to bluff his way into culinary school. He lives in fear that this will be revealed, and will go to considerable lengths to protect his false identity.


**Gardener** - Bottom - Murderer</br>
Species: Fennec Fox (?)</br>
Name: Gabriel Greene</br>
Gabriel is the murderer. He is secretly romantically involved with Maximilian. Their relationship is kept a secret because their respective families disapprove.


**Butler** - Top</br>
Species: Friesian Horse</br>
Name: Florian Fortier</br>
Florian has been in the aristocrat's employ the longest. He was on good terms with the victim, but some modernisations at the estate have put his job in peril. Murdering the estate agent may put those plans on ice, securing his position and influence.

The gardener commits the murder by first knocking the victim unconscious with a shovel, then dropping a chandelier onto the victim.

### Chapter 1
Introduction to premise. Scene between Robert and Sebastian.

Sebastian got into a fight with Levi over gym management, but it wasn't serious and they made up soon after. His name is quickly cleared when it becomes apparent that he has no real motive for murder.</br>
Sebastian leads Robert to Claude, hinting that the chef had it in for Levi. However, this may be false as Sebastian dislikes Claude for making him look bad as a PT and dietician.</br>

### Chapter 2
Scene between Robert and Claude.

Claude is the estate chef. He is involved in the estate's purchases and is the one who discovers that Levi has been embezzling money. However, he is reluctant to take action as Levi knows that he is living under a false identity.</br>
Claude has a weak motive for murder, but no inclination to go through with the deed. If the estate faces bankruptcy, Maximilian's reference and his experience will all but guarantee him a job at any restaurant he wishes.</br>
Claude has a long-standing conflict with Sebastian. The latter thinks that the chef should prepare healthier food for Maximilian, whereas Claude simply follows Maximilian's wishes. In the eyes of the world, this makes Sebastian look like an incompetent PT.</br>
Claude eventually confides the information about Levi's mismanagement to his friend, Gabriel. Claude thinks that the gardener will tell Maximilian or alert the authorities, but he is unaware of the relationship between Gabriel and Maximilian.

### Chapter 3
Scene between Robert and Gabriel.
'
Gabriel Greene is the estate gardener. He is secretly romantically involved with Maximilian. The two have mutually decided to keep their relationship discreet, as their respective families would disapprove. They are planning to make it public eventually, and both look forward to living together openly.</br>
When Gabriel finds out that Levi has been stealing from the estate, he confronts Levi. The agent, however, retaliates by blackmailing him with evidence of his affair with Maximilian. In desperation, Gabriel hits Levi with a shovel, knocking him unconscious. Realising what he's done, he severs the tether holding up the chandelier in the dining room and drops it on the gardener.</br>
However, none of this is made apparent to Robert immediately. Gabriel denies any knowledge of Levi's death and instead deflects blame to the butler. Without knowledge of Gabriel and Maximilian secretly having an affair, Gabriel has no motive to murder Levi.

### Chapter 4
Scene between Robert and Florian.

Florian has both means and motive to commit murder. Levi's mismanagement of the estate threatens his livelihood, and his modernisations are rapidly making a butler superfluous. All the other estate staff could easily find other jobs, but Florian's predicament is more severe.</br>
Ultimately, however, Florian is unaware of Levi's criminal enterprise and is likely to retire quite soon.
