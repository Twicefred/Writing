# Private Eye Porn

**When a dead body is discovered in the dining room of a vast country mansion, detective Robert Rizzolini is called to the scene to investigate. Using his second-to-none powers of deduction, he cracks the case.**

**I originally wrote this as a weird pornographic detective pastiche, but I ended up cutting out all the horny bits. Something about sex scenes and murder mystery doesn't quite satisfy me.**

# Chapter 1

Maximilian Morganstein closed the front door behind him. Home at last. The entry hall was dark, save for a sliver of moonlight shining through the stained glass windows. It was enough for Maximilian's keen feline eyes, and he strode quietly through to the great hall just adjacent.

Leaving his luggage on the dark green carpet, Maximilian yawned and stretched. He was tired from his journey, but not sleepy.</br>
'*Florian will be most upset I had to let myself in,*' The lion thought, unbuttoning his coat and throwing it onto the luggage. Florian, his butler, would take care of it in the morning.

It was late, closer to morning than evening, but Maximilian had travelled far and hadn't quite turned the clock back fully. He'd need to get some sleep eventually, but for now he could settle in with a drink and a good book.</br>
Opening the door to the dining room, he felt his way along the wall to where he knew a few bottles of liquor would be. The dining room was darker, the moon didn't quite shine through the tall windows.</br>
Maximilian picked up a glass from the small wet bar he had set up, but there wasn't at all enough light to pour a drink. Leading the way with one paw stretched out, he looked for the light switch.

Maximilian switched the light on and turned around. Immediately the room was bathed in warm light from two of the three great crystal chandeliers. The lion's breath caught in his throat as his eyes adjusted to the light. In shock, the glass he'd been holding slipped from his paw and shattered against the dark hardwood floor.</br>

Robert Rizzolini's trained eyes surveyed the room. A gruesome scene, truly, but he'd seen worse in his days.

"And that's when I saw it," Maximilian said, turning to avoid the gore in front of him.

The green Persian rug was soaked with congealed blood. In the very middle, a great chandelier fallen from above. The delicate crystals and shining metal barely covered the dead racoon beneath it. It was safe to assume that this wasn't a natural death.

"I understand the deceased had been in your employ for quite some time?"

"Indeed he had," Maximilian said, frowning. "I'm sorry, detective, but can we perhaps continue our conversation elsewhere?"

Robert nodded his agreement and Maximilian led them out of the dining room into the adjacent library. Robert's shoes creaked against the floor, but despite his considerable size, Maximilian's naked paws were completely silent.

"I hired Levi five years ago," Maximilian said, motioning for Robert to sit down in a green velvet sofa. "His father had worked for me earlier, so he was a perfect candidate for the job. Estates like these are a rare sight these days, and we have to be clever to survive. Levi does-" Maximilian stopped himself, the sofa creaking as he sank into the cushions. "Levi *did* a lot to modernise and save this house from ruin. I wouldn't be sitting here today if it weren't for him."

"It sounds like you were close. I'm sorry for your loss Mr. Morganstein," Robert said. The lion nodded back. He kept a stiff upper lip, but Robert could tell that Levi Lawson's death weighed heavily on his mind. Then again, finding a dead body on your dinner table would throw anyone for a loop.

"Can you think of anyone who Levi didn't get along with? Any recent events which made you concerned for him?"

"To my knowledge, Levi got along well with everyone. He was a quiet type, but I never knew him to make any enemies."

Robert's gaze wandered around the room as Maximilian described what he knew of Levi's relationships. Not much in the way of family, except a sister in the nearby village. A few friends, but none lived close by.

Levi's body was discovered in the dining room. While an autopsy hadn't been performed, Robert assumed the cause of death was being crushed beneath the chandelier. '*That would mean the killer is likely someone in the mansion household,*' Robert thought. At the very least, someone on the inside was a co-conspirator. He'd need a list of staff members to speak to, but where to begin?

"The only thing I can think of, is a fight Levi got into with Sebastian a month ago," Maximilian said, leaning forward in the sofa. A fight? That was a place to start.

"What was it about?"

"I can't remember, I don't think it was very serious. Sebastian is a tad hot-headed, so it doesn't surprise me. I only learned of it second-hand when Florian mentioned it to me."

"And who is Sebastian?" Robert asked, pulling a weathered notebook from his coat pocket.

"He's my personal trainer and dietician," Maximilian said. "I take my health seriously, and Sebastian is the very best in the business."

Robert looked at the lion sitting in front of him. '*There's no way this guy follows advice from a PT,*' He thought. Maximilian did not look like a man who spent any significant time in a gym. The way in which he filled out his tweed jacket testified to a love of good food and good living. Robert didn't mind the lion's looks, he was quite a striking figure, but why tell such an obvious lie?

"Where might I find him?"

"The gym is downstairs, I'm happy to take you there," Maximilian said, standing up and beckoning Robert to follow.

"You have a personal trainer and a private gym in the basement?" Robert asked. He couldn't entirely hide his surprise, it seemed lavish even for someone of Maximilian's wealth.

"It's available for the staff to use as well, most find it to be a nice benefit," The lion said as they walked together. He led Robert through a series of rooms and corridors, each more opulently furnished than the next.

While they walked, Robert attempted a mental map of the vast estate. The building centred around a grand entry hall, with two wings on either side. On one side lay the dining room, library and drawing room. On the other side were rooms displaying the family Morganstein's vast collection of artworks.</br>
Each wing of the building connected to the basement via several smaller stairways, all hidden away behind colonnades and inconspicuous doors.</br>
The second floor, in turn, was only accessible via a central grand staircase and one passageway for servants. It housed bedrooms and guest rooms, as well as Maximilian's offices.

The gym was the most austere room in the mansion, filled only with weights and modern workout machines. The far wall was covered in mirrors, making the room appear much larger than it really was.

"Sebastian should be around here somewhere," Maximilian said, looking around the room. To Robert, it seemed obvious he didn't visit very often.

"So, what's your role here?" Robert asked as 


"What was your relationship to Mr. Lawson?" Robert asked, sitting down on the padded bench of a nearby workout machine. Sebastian's tail swished in annoyance behind him. Robert knew this was the wrong form for this particular machine, but he didn't care enough to change position.

"I didn't really have one," Sebastian said, leaning against the wall. "All the purchases for the gym went through him, but I didn't do much more than give him a list of what I needed."

"Mr. Morganstein claims you were in a fight with him," Robert said, peering up at Sebastian.

"A fight?" Sebastian looked taken aback. "Do you mean the argument we had about
