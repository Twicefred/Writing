The two spend the car ride talking about Francis's memories of the place, and later explore the house together.</br>
Their plan is to spend a week there, and it's quickly becoming clear that a deeply emotional place is bringing about conversations and situations that test their resolve as a couple.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Francis and Ricard in the car. They are driving through sunny fields with the radio on. Francis laments the fact that his phone can't get internet connection while Ricard drives. The car is an old Mercedes-Benz that Ricard works on in their spare time. They both agree that they should probably have taken Francis's SUV instead, but Ricard doesn't enjoy driving it. Francis points out that the Mercedes is more difficult for him to drive, Ricard makes a joke about Francis's height.

### Scene 2

The sun is beginning to set as they arrive at the house. Francis comments on how overgrown it looks. We are given a short overview of the state of the villa. Francis unlocks the front door

## Chapter Begins

The old Mercedes drove off the asphalt and onto the dirt road. Sun-baked fields of grain flew by as rubber tires screeched against seldom-travelled gravel. It was the peak of summer. Rain hadn't come for weeks, causing a cloud of dust to form behind the car as it rolled steadily down the road.

"We should have taken my car instead," Francis said, clutching his phone tight with his paws, lest an especially large pothole cause it to fly out the open window. The seatbelt did little to restrain him in his seat as the roadway buckled beneath them. Francis only hoped he wouldn't have to dig his claws into the leather as he tried to not tumble down to the floor.

"We could have," Ricard replied, hands steady on the steering wheel, though his knuckles were bright white in veiled exertion. "But there's no feeling in it. No soul." Ricard's voice strained on the last part. He meant what he said, but even he could sense that a more modern car might have handled the trip with less trouble.

"You're not supposed to 'feel' the road, you're supposed to travel along it," Francis said. He could have elaborated further, but chose to respect his fiancé's concentration. Francis understood Ricard's love for the old car, but he didn't always look forward to riding it.

"Either way, when else would I get to drive her?" Ricard said, leaning into a curve and smiling to himself. With his sunglasses, blue linen jacket and carefully unkempt hair, he was the dashing image of a bohemian dandy. A road trip was really just another runway.

Francis looked at Ricard beside him. He smiled and shook his head.

"Just don't get too busy admiring yourself in the mirror, love," Francis said. He put his phone down. There was almost no cell coverage. For the moment, it was only them and the road. Only them, and a journey he'd been putting off until there weren't any excuses left for him to make.

Sensing that the road had seemed to smooth out some, Ricard took one hand off the wheel and held it out to his right. Francis smiled and took it, letting Ricard's bigger fingers stroke his soft paw. Francis stretched out in the supple leather seat. Despite it not being a very large car, he couldn't quite reach the floor. '*And he wonders why I prefer driving my own car,*' Francis thought. He swished his tail in momentary annoyance, but banished the notion quickly. He could put up with indulging his fiancé's love for the old hunk of metal, even if it meant his own mild discomfort.

Seemingly endless fields of sunflowers and rye sped past them, only broken up by stretches of oak forest, but Francis began to recognise the sparse few landmarks one could see from the road. He craned his neck out the open window, watching as a familiar landscape began to unfold.

Stretched out against the backdrop of grain and shrubs was the old forest. It ran in an unbroken line until an hour away by bicycle where a river bisected the farmland. His sister had told Francis that the water flowed down from the mountains when it snowed. Francis hadn't questioned her theory, despite the lack of both mountains and snow nearby.</br>
Patricia had fed Francis a multitude of amusing lies throughout their childhood, and their mother inevitably had to dispel them at some point. Francis had cried when Patricia, voice full of falsified concern, had told him that his tail would fall off if he wet his bed again. In retrospect, it was mildly funny. In the moment, it was only the casual cruelty with which you treat your annoying younger siblings.

The road grew rougher as they neared the treeline. No one had bothered to maintain this stretch for years, and it showed in the multitude of holes and stray branches that had fallen onto the roadway. Ricard flicked his sunglasses up off his nose and focused intently on the road. Above, a canopy of leaves shrouded them from the sunlight.

The dirt road carried on for miles through the forest. Even further on was THE TOWN, though new roads had since been built that connected to the freeway, leaving the gravel roads all but abandoned.

"Up there, by the birches," Francis said, pointing to a pair of tall birch trees standing out against the oak surroundings. Next to them was a red mailbox and an, if possible, even more primitive dirt road leading further into the woods.

Ricard leaned forward and steered the car down the forest path. Grass had grown over much of the roadway, and the tires crept slowly along the ground. Francis held his breath as he saw light ahead.

Ricard stopped the car. The forest had cleared, leaving them in a natural meadow. In the middle, partly obscured by planted trees and tall rose bushes, sat an old yellow wooden house. The shutters were open, but it did little to convince anyone that the house was inhabited.

"Wow," Ricard said, opening the door and stepping out. He stretched and walked slowly toward the house. The path ahead of them was lined by overgrown rose bushes that had spilled over the gravel. He smiled and took a step back as a pleasantly fat bumblebee flew past his face. Everywhere around them were the sights of a beloved garden deep in decline.

"I wonder who Patricia thought she could sell this place to," Francis said, silently walking up behind Ricard. "I don't think even *I* could find a good buyer."

"Surely someone would be interested," Ricard said. His eyes wandered around the garden. The sound of insects and birds was constant, like they'd stumbled upon a secret wildlife choir. "It's beautiful and in good shape. It looks like a fairy tale, Francis."

"It's also remote, and I don't know in how good shape it really is," Francis said. He narrowed his eyes, slowly walking beside Ricard toward the front porch.

"Take off your work glasses for a moment, love," Ricard said, laying an arm around the fox's shoulders. Francis leaned into Ricard's side. "Just because you see an old house in need of repair doesn't mean someone else can't see much more than that."

They reached the wooden porch and climbed the steps up. The floorboards creaked and shifted slightly under their weight. Francis shot Ricard a glance to the effect of 'see what I mean?'. Ricard had to lean down to avoid bumping his head against a multitude of glass trinkets and dreamcatchers that hung from the porch ceiling. The veranda, much like the rest of the house, he suspected, was built for a family of shorter people.

Hesitating for a second, Francis produced a key and unlocked the front door. With Ricard's hand against his back, he swung the door open.

"Home sweet home," Francis said, stepping over the threshold.

The air inside was cold and damp, despite the summer sun. Francis coughed as their footsteps kicked up little clouds of dust from the hall carpet. Ricard walked silently just behind Francis. He felt like he was stepping into an abandoned museum, one dedicated to someone else's memories.

A small selection of shoes lined the hallway leading into the rest of the house. Most of them were practical footwear, made for rough terrain, but some were of finer make with ornate clasps and heels. They didn't seem to have seen as much use.

The walls were covered in little paintings and photographs. Ricard squinted to make out the details, but in the dim lighting he couldn't see much of them.

"Pat must have barely gotten started here," Francis said as they stepped into the living room. Ricard flicked a light switch, letting a cheap glass chandelier illuminate the room. "She said she wanted to pack up all the furniture and store it..." Francis trailed off, standing in the centre of the room.

"How are you-" Ricard began, but Francis interrupted him.

"This was her favourite spot," Francis said, pointing to a well-worn chintz armchair. "She always sat there to read." He ran a paw over the cloth, brushing tufts of dust to the floor. "It's the only place in the house where you get evening sun through a window at the right angle."

Ricard leaned against the doorway, observing quietly as Francis elaborated on the virtues of this particular armchair.

"You never answered my question," Ricard said. Francis sighed and fell silent.

"How do I feel?" Francis turned around. Specks of dust swirled in the air from the sudden appearance of people in the abandoned room. "I've felt better..." He said, casting his gaze down.

Ricard approached him, leaning down and wrapping his arms around the fox. Francis pressed himself against the taller human, closing his eyes as Ricard brushed his fingers through his plush fur.

"Well, I'm glad I get to be here with you," Ricard said, pulling Francis with him to sit down on a sofa by the window. The cushions sighed as they sat down. Ricard reached up behind them and opened the window, letting the summer breeze replace the stale air. White lace curtains fluttered in the soft wind, casting shadows across the room.

"I wasn't so sure about coming back here," Francis said. He looked around the cramped room. His mother's tendency to fill every available surface with decorations and misplaced keepsakes had only gotten stronger in her old age. Piles of books dotted the side tables in the room; little vases with dried flowers were perched precariously on top.

"Why? I didn't think you had bad memories from here?"

"I don't. Not really anyway," Francis said. Ricard looked silently at him. "I don't know, it's just weird."

"Weird in a bad way or some other way?"

"Are you my psychologist now?" Francis looked up at Ricard who laughed back at him.

"I'll be whatever you need me to be," Ricard said.

--

All things considered, Francis thought, the kitchen was in good shape. Ever the gentleman, Ricard had insisted that he carry all the groceries inside while Francis figured out whether any of the kitchen appliances still worked.

Thankfully, Patricia had managed to throw out all the perishable food from the fridge and pantry, so there wasn't much cleaning needed. When Ricard had carted in the food they'd brought with them, they were left with their own provisions and an assortment of questionable fruit preserves and jams that had escaped Patricia's cleaning.

"Do you think these are still good?" Ricard said, holding up a jar of orange marmalade to the light. "I remember Mona gave me a bunch of these when she came to visit, but I never got to eat all of them."

"She was ever fond of unloading food on people," Francis said, turning the kitchen tap and wincing at the rust brown water that rushed forth. "It's charming when you get them a few times a year, but me and Pat had to actually eat all the stuff she couldn't give away. I've had more toast with marmalade than you can imagine."

"Too much of a good thing?"

"*Way* too much of a good thing," Francis said. With the tap running to clear the water, he turned his attention to the refrigerator. It was old and bulky, like a bathtub turned on its side and stapled to the wall. Francis wouldn't be surprised if it held up a significant part of the house, it had been there so long as he could remember.

Francis flicked a dusty switch on the side and the fridge clattered to life. Ricard looked at it, wide-eyed.

"It probably won't explode," Francis said, smiling at his fiancé.

"That thing is a monstrosity," Ricard said, approaching the way-too-loud appliance. "Yet it has an undeniable charm."

"That could describe many things in this house," Francis said. He picked up the jar of marmalade that Ricard had put down on the kitchen counter. "Did you remember to bring a loaf of bread?"

"Do you actually want to eat that?" Ricard said, turning in surprise as Francis struggled with the lid.

"Yeah, of course I do," Francis said, gritting his teeth with effort before giving up and handing the jar to Ricard. "I loosened it for you." He grinned as Ricard opened it without much exertion.

--

Mona Barr occupied far more of the room than her short stature should allow. She was everywhere at once, and nowhere was this more apparent than her own kitchen. Francis sat down at the kitchen table and observed as his mother did the dishes, prepared lemonade and watered the plants at the same time as she vividly recounted her latest gardening endeavour. He had offered to help, but she had insisted that he sit down and relax. Apparently, he worked too hard.

"They make it so easy nowadays, I almost feel like I'm cheating!" Mona said, twirling around and placing a pitcher of fresh lemonade on the table. "When I was your age, I'd have to find someone to build it all for me, and it would cost a fortune. Now? I just ordered a kit and I can put together a greenhouse on my own!"

Francis nodded along with his mother's enthusiasm. While she went on about how painless mail ordering was, he studied the room. He hadn't visited in over a year, but the room was unchanged.

"Actually, I wanted to tell you something," Francis interjected when Mona paused to take a breath. She sat down next to him at the table, eyes wide and ears forward with interest. Francis smiled and poured a glass of lemonade. "I've met someone, and I think we're going to move in together."

Mona was silent for a moment, then her face cracked into a grin and she lunged at her son.

"My darling boy!" She threw her arms around Francis, who happily returned her embrace. She kissed him on the cheek and pulled back, face sparkling with excitement. "Who is he? What's his name?"

"His name's Ricard," Francis began. His face felt hot. He was happy to share the news, but telling your mother that you've met someone new always makes you feel like a teenager talking about their first crush. "He's a journalist at the *St. Carmen Daily*. We met when they were moving into their new offices downtown."

Mona stared intently at her son, paws fidgeting in her lap excitedly. Francis took a sip of lemonade and took out his phone.

"Do you want to see a picture?" He asked. His mother nodded instantly, craning her neck over to see the screen.

The image was of Francis and Ricard at a local beach. They were right next to each other, faces pressed tight together to fit in the frame. Francis knew that just below the picture, Ricard's arms held him up so their heads would be level with the camera. Francis wouldn't say it out loud, but Ricard knew he loved being held that way.

"What a handsome man," Mona said, squinting her eyes to get every detail she possibly could out of the picture. There was some surprise in her voice, but not the judgmental or unpleasant kind. She'd always thought her son would choose another fox, not a lanky human who distinctly lacked fur. Mona was long since at peace with not getting any grandchildren. Francis was gay, and Patricia seemed wholly uninterested in having children. Consequently, it didn't matter much to her what partner her son chose, she had no stake in the matter. She would have liked it if her children had seen the same joy in parenthood as she had, but Mona realised it was rather selfish to expect your children to conform to your expectations of *their* adulthood.

Francis swiped past yet more pictures of himself and Ricard, eagerly showing them to his mother. She drank in every one with the same enthusiasm, commenting on what a beautiful couple they made, how tall and handsome Ricard was, and how happy they looked together.

"I love him."

Mona went quiet, looking at Francis. It took him a minute to realise that his audience was no longer focused on the images he was showing, but on himself.

"I can tell," Mona said, laying an arm around her son. "You're no great mystery, sweetheart. I'm so glad you're happy."

--

They ate their toast in the sun room, opposite the kitchen. Francis recalled it had originally been something different, but Mona had contracted a cousin to tear out a wall and build a greenhouse extension on the side of the house. Patricia and he had given their mother endless grief about how cold it got in the winter if they didn't keep a fire going constantly, but their concerns had fallen on deaf ears.

Francis had to admit, though, it was a nice place during the summer.

"I've counted, how many plants do you think there are in this room?" Ricard said, leaning back in a ragged armchair.

"Zero live ones, that part is easy at least," Francis said. "Maybe fifty or so?"

"Fifty-eight, good guess," Ricard said, plucking a dried leaf off a small ficus tree next to him. "You always said your mother enjoyed gardening, but caring for all this must have been a full-time endeavour."

"There isn't much else to do out here," Francis said, looking out over the garden through the windows. The fruit trees were in full bloom, bathing the scene in white and pink blossoms. "Unless you just love being alone and isolated, you have to pick up gardening or some other hobby to stay sane."

"Lucky you handle loneliness so well."

"You joke, but I wish I had inherited some of that. Patricia got all those genes. I don't think she enjoyed anyone's company as much as her own."

"Then why did she insist on selling? You'd think she would be thrilled to make this place her own if she enjoyed being on her own so much."

"Because mum never wrote a will," Francis said. "When she died, the estate was divided between me and Pat. We ended up with joint ownership of the house. Either we sell it or she would have to buy my share from me."

"And I imagine your sister needed the money," Ricard said, looking at Francis. His fiancé was by all accounts a successful man. Patricia had been less fortunate.

"She did," Francis said and sighed.

"Isn't there a third option? Couldn't you have given her your share of the house?"

"I could have, if she had asked," Francis said. "But she wouldn't have. She was too stubborn for that. You know the amount of times we offered to help her only for her to refuse. I couldn't have forced her to accept something she didn't want."

"No, she would have been offended by that," Ricard said. Francis stared straight ahead in mild annoyance. His sister's vagaries had never failed to set his teeth on edge.

--

Francis had sold the homes of dead people before. Every case had been different, but the basic procedure never differed much. He would offer condolences and relate to whatever anecdote the family told him. Ultimately, it didn't matter much to his business.

Patricia had made all the paperwork ready, and to his eyes it was all prim and proper. But this wasn't any ordinary house. Any old widow can tumble down the steps one day and without much delay, the vultures would descend to pick apart the estate for anything of value. That, curiously, hadn't been the case here. There wasn't much of economical value to be found, and there weren't any vultures either.</br>
There's a special kind of loneliness to be found where a deceased person's belongings are left the way they are. Not even the base greed of all sentient beings calling out to anyone.

"Francis!" Ricard called from out front. The voice was different, but Francis had been called out onto the porch before. Francis put down the papers and walked out the front door. Ricard had finally taken off his sunglasses and had located one of the wicker couches on the veranda. "Come sit down," He said, smiling and holding two glasses of clear liquid with ice. Gin, Francis correctly guessed.

After the scorching daytime heat, the evening air was a pleasant change of pace. Francis sat down on the couch and took the drink he was offered. Ricard had known to pack a respectable assortment of beverages. The nearest grocery store was an hour away, and Francis didn't recall their selection to be particularly inspiring.

"I feel like I should have something poignant to say," Francis said. He leaned against Ricard who ran a hand over his head, stroking the soft fur behind his rakish ears. It was all the response he needed.

They each drank from their glass, listening to the sounds around them. Throughout the garden, birds and crickets alike serenaded the arrival of the night.

"I know I'm repeating myself, but this looks like a fairy tale," Ricard said, gesturing vaguely to the garden in front of them. "I feel like I'm going to blink and suddenly realise I was watching a movie instead."

"Better not blink, then," Francis said, clenching his jaw as he swallowed an ice-cold shot of gin.

"What's the matter, Francis?" Ricard said, reaching back and putting his glass on the windowsill behind them. "You can tell me about your thoughts."

"Patricia could have sold our childhood home and I wouldn't have been at all involved. I would never have seen this place again." A moth fluttered past them both, enthralled by the dim porch lights. "She even asked me to be a part of it and I declined. What was I thinking?"

"We've been over this, love," Ricard said. "You can't blame yourself for things that are out of your control. It wasn't your fault. None of it."

"It doesn't always feel that way to me."

"That doesn't mean that those thoughts are true," Ricard said. His eyes wandered to the open trunk of the car in the driveway. He wanted to refill both their glasses, but it seemed an inopportune moment. "I know how this goes. You blame yourself for working too hard, and then you bury yourself in more work to stop those feelings." Francis looked up at him and began to answer, but Ricard cut him off. "I'm not calling you out just to be unpleasant, I'm trying to get you to understand that this guilt isn't helping anyone."

They both were silent, eyes drifting over the garden. It was a moment where neither wanted to say something, but they both knew that eventually the silence had to be broken.

"I'll try," Francis said. Ricard smiled at him.

"That's all I ask."

-skip-

"Really?" Francis said, tilting his head.

"Yep. It's for your own good," Ricard said, smiling at his fiancés annoyed face.

"Fine, I guess," Francis said, struggling to keep his steely face as Ricard leaned down and lifted him into his arms. "But I fail to see how this is for my own good. I have the same amount of legs that you do, shouldn't I get to use them?"

"You make a good point," Ricard said, cradling the smaller fox in his embrace. "But if I wasn't supposed to carry you, then why are you the perfect size for me to do so?"

"That's highly subjective," Francis said, resting his head against Ricard's shoulder. He smelled vaguely of fabric softener and bergamot cologne.

"Not to me, it's not," Ricard said, rubbing his cheek against the top of Francis's head. "You also enjoy it." Francis scoffed but pushed his snout against Ricard's throat, breathing in the familiar scent.

"I made the bed in the guest room," Francis said, directing Ricard through the darkened house.

"Either you're banishing me to sleep separately, or you don't want to desecrate your mother's bedroom," Ricard said, smiling gleefully at Francis.

"Keep at it and I might just choose the former."

Ricard carried Francis into the guest room, lighting the dim ceiling lamp as they entered. Mona had never had many guests, so Ricard guessed that this was the least used room in the house. As tends to be the case with guest rooms, it was decorated with the wall art that Mona had bought but didn't particularly like.

"This used to be my room," Francis said, looking around as Ricard sat him down on the bed.

--

"You think too much, Francis," Ricard said, pulling the covers over them.

"Maybe," Francis whispered, letting Ricard pull him close.

"You definitely do," Ricard said, cradling Francis's head against his neck. "You're such a sweetheart, but you need to get out of your own head sometimes."

Francis didn't reply, he'd already closed his eyes. Ricard held him tight, running his fingers through the fox's bright red fur. All wrapped up and relaxed, Ricard felt like he was holding a large stuffed animal. He sighed and watched Francis's calm face.

"I love you," Ricard whispered, planting a kiss on top of Francis's head. He got a low mumble in response and smiled as
