## Chapter Outline

    Francis and Ricard arrive at Francis's childhood home in the countryside. With his mother having passed away, Francis has inherited the house and land.
    The two spend the car ride talking about Francis's memories of the place, and later explore the house together.
    Their plan is to spend a week there, and it's quickly becoming clear that a deeply emotional place is bringing about conversations and situations that test their resolve as a couple.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

    Francis and Ricard in the car. They are driving through sunny fields with the radio on. Francis laments the fact that his phone can't get internet connection while Ricard drives. The car is an old Mercedes-Benz that Ricard works on in their spare time. They both agree that they should probably have taken Francis's SUV instead, but Ricard doesn't enjoy driving it. Francis points out that the Mercedes is more difficult for him to drive, Ricard makes a joke about Francis's height.

### Scene 2

    The sun is beginning to set as they arrive at the house. Francis comments on how overgrown it looks. We are given a short overview of the state of the villa. Francis unlocks the front door

## Chapter Begins

With a cloud of dust trailing behind it, the old Mercedes drove off the asphalt and onto the gravel road. The suspension creaked as the bumps in the road caused the tightly packed trunk to clatter with heavy luggage.

"We should have taken my car instead," Francis said, clutching his phone tight with his paws, lest an especially large pothole caused it to fly out the open window.

"We could have," Ricard replied, hands steady on the steering wheel. "But there's no feeling in it. No soul."

"You're not supposed to 'feel' the road, you're supposed to travel along it," Francis said. He could have elaborated further, but chose to respect his fiancé's concentration. Francis understood Ricard's love for the old car, but he didn't particularly relish riding it.

"Either way, when else would I get to drive her?" Ricard said, leaning into a curve and smiling to himself. With his sunglasses, blue linen jacket and carefully unkempt hair, he was the dashing image of a bohemian dandy.

Francis looked at Ricard beside him. He smiled and shook his head.

"Just don't get too busy admiring yourself in the mirror, love," Francis said. He put his phone down. There was almost no cell coverage. For the moment, it was only them and the road.

Sensing that the road had seemed to smooth out some, Ricard took one hand off the wheel and held it out to his right. Francis smiled and took it, letting Ricard's bigger fingers stroke his soft paw. Francis stretched out in the supple leather seat. Despite it not being a very large car, he couldn't quite reach the floor. '*And he wonders why I prefer driving my own car,*' Francis thought. He swished his tail in momentary annoyance, but banished the notion quickly. He could put up with indulging his fiancé's love for the old hunk of metal, even if it meant his own mild discomfort.

Seemingly endless fields of sunflowers and rye sped past them, only broken up by stretches of oak forest, but Francis began to recognise the sparse few landmarks one could see from the road. He craned his neck out the open window, watching as a familiar landscape began to unfold.

Stretched out against the backdrop of grain and shrubs was the old forest. It ran in an unbroken line until an hour away by bicycle where a river bisected the farmland. Francis had spent considerable time there, whittling boats out of pine bark and watching them float downstream.

The road grew rougher as they neared the forest line. No one had bothered to maintain this stretch for years, and it showed in the multitude of holes and stray branches that had fallen onto the roadway. Ricard flicked his sunglasses up off his nose and focused intently on the road. Above, a canopy of leaves shrouded them from the sunlight.

The dirt road carried on for miles through the forest. Even further on was THE TOWN, though new roads had since been built that connected to the freeway, leaving the gravel roads all but abandoned.

Ricard slowed down as the forest grew sparser.

"Up there, by the birches," Francis said, pointing to a pair of tall birch trees standing out against the oak surroundings. Next to them was a red mailbox and an, if possible, even more primitive dirt road leading further into the woods.

Ricard leaned forward and steered the car down the forest path. Grass had grown over much of the roadway, and the tires crept slowly along the ground. Francis held his breath as he saw light ahead.

Ricard stopped the car. The forest had cleared, leaving them in a natural meadow. In the middle, partly obscured by planted trees and tall rose bushes, sat an old wood house. The shutters were open, but it did little to convince anyone that the house was inhabited.

"Wow," Ricard said, opening the door and stepping out. He stretched and walked slowly toward the house. The path ahead of them was lined by overgrown rose bushes that had spilled over the gravel. He smiled and took a step back as a pleasantly fat bumblebee almost flew into his face. Everywhere around them were the sights of a beloved garden deep in decline.

"I wonder who Patricia thought she could sell this place to," Francis said, silently walking up behind Ricard. "I don't think even *I* could find a good buyer."
