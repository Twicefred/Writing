## Scenes

### Scene 1

Francis and Ricard in the car. They are driving through sunny fields with the radio on. Francis laments the fact that his phone can't get internet connection while Ricard drives. The car is an old Mercedes-Benz that Ricard works on in their spare time. They both agree that they should probably have taken Francis's SUV instead, but Ricard doesn't enjoy driving it. Francis points out that the Mercedes is more difficult for him to drive, Ricard makes a joke about Francis's height.

### Scene 2

The sun is beginning to set as they arrive at the house. Francis comments on how overgrown it looks. We are given a short overview of the state of the villa. Francis unlocks the front door

## Chapter Begins

The old Mercedes drove off the asphalt and onto the dirt road. Sun-baked fields of grain flew by as rubber tires screeched against seldom-travelled gravel. It was the peak of summer. Rain hadn't come for weeks, causing a cloud of dust to form behind the car as it rolled steadily down the road.

"We should have taken my car instead," Francis said, clutching his phone tight with his paws, lest an especially large pothole cause it to fly out the open window. The seatbelt did little to restrain him in his seat as the roadway buckled beneath them. Francis only hoped he wouldn't have to dig his claws into the leather as he tried to not tumble down to the floor.

"We could have," Ricard replied, hands steady on the steering wheel, though his knuckles were bright white in veiled exertion. "But there's no feeling in it. No soul." Ricard's voice strained on the last part. He meant what he said, but even he could sense that a more modern car might have handled the trip with less trouble.

"You're not supposed to 'feel' the road, you're supposed to travel along it," Francis said. He could have elaborated further, but chose to respect his fiancé's concentration. Francis understood Ricard's love for the old car, but he didn't always look forward to riding it.

"Either way, when else would I get to drive her?" Ricard said, leaning into a curve and smiling to himself. With his sunglasses, blue linen jacket and carefully unkempt hair, he was the dashing image of a bohemian dandy. A road trip was really just another runway.

Francis looked at Ricard beside him. He smiled and shook his head.

"Just don't get too busy admiring yourself in the mirror, love," Francis said. He put his phone down. There was almost no cell coverage. For the moment, it was only them and the road. Only them, and a journey he'd been putting off until there weren't any excuses left for him to make.

Sensing that the road had seemed to smooth out some, Ricard took one hand off the wheel and held it out to his right. Francis smiled and took it, letting Ricard's bigger fingers stroke his soft paw. Francis stretched out in the supple leather seat. Despite it not being a very large car, he couldn't quite reach the floor. '*And he wonders why I prefer driving my own car,*' Francis thought. He swished his tail in momentary annoyance, but banished the notion quickly. He could put up with indulging his fiancé's love for the old hunk of metal, even if it meant his own mild discomfort.

Seemingly endless fields of sunflowers and rye sped past them, only broken up by stretches of oak forest, but Francis began to recognise the sparse few landmarks one could see from the road. He craned his neck out the open window, watching as a familiar landscape began to unfold.

Stretched out against the backdrop of grain and shrubs was the old forest. It ran in an unbroken line until an hour away by bicycle where a river bisected the farmland. His sister had told Francis that the water flowed down from the mountains when it snowed. Francis hadn't questioned her theory, despite the lack of both mountains and snow nearby.</br>
Patricia had fed Francis a multitude of amusing lies throughout their childhood, and their mother inevitably had to dispel them at some point. Francis had cried when Patricia, voice full of falsified concern, had told him that his tail would fall off if he wet his bed again. In retrospect, it was mildly funny. In the moment, it was only the casual cruelty with which you treat your annoying younger siblings.

The road grew rougher as they neared the treeline. No one had bothered to maintain this stretch for years, and it showed in the multitude of holes and stray branches that had fallen onto the roadway. Ricard flicked his sunglasses up off his nose and focused intently on the road. Above, a canopy of leaves shrouded them from the sunlight.

The dirt road carried on for miles through the forest. Even further on was THE TOWN, though new roads had since been built that connected to the freeway, leaving the gravel roads all but abandoned.

"Up there, by the birches," Francis said, pointing to a pair of tall birch trees standing out against the oak surroundings. Next to them was a red mailbox and an, if possible, even more primitive dirt road leading further into the woods.

Ricard leaned forward and steered the car down the forest path. Grass had grown over much of the roadway, and the tires crept slowly along the ground. Francis held his breath as he saw light ahead.

Ricard stopped the car. The forest had cleared, leaving them in a natural meadow. In the middle, partly obscured by planted trees and tall rose bushes, sat an old wooden house. The shutters were open, but it did little to convince anyone that the house was inhabited.

"Wow," Ricard said, opening the door and stepping out. He stretched and walked slowly toward the house. The path ahead of them was lined by overgrown rose bushes that had spilled over the gravel. He smiled and took a step back as a pleasantly fat bumblebee flew past his face. Everywhere around them were the sights of a beloved garden deep in decline.

"I wonder who Patricia thought she could sell this place to," Francis said, silently walking up behind Ricard. "I don't think even *I* could find a good buyer."

"Surely someone would be interested," Ricard said. His eyes wandered around the garden. The sound of insects and birds was constant, like they'd stumbled upon a secret wildlife choir. "It's beautiful and in good shape. It looks like a fairy tale, Francis."

"It's also remote, and I don't know in how good shape it really is," Francis said. He narrowed his eyes, slowly walking beside Ricard toward the front porch.

"Take off your work glasses for a moment, love," Ricard said, laying an arm around the fox's shoulders. Francis leaned into Ricard's side. "Just because you see an old house in need of repair doesn't mean someone else can't see much more than that."

They reached the wooden porch and climbed the steps up. The floorboards creaked and shifted slightly under their weight. Francis shot Ricard a glance to the effect of 'see what I mean?'. Ricard had to lean down slightly to avoid bumping his head against a multitude of glass trinkets and dreamcatchers that hung from the porch ceiling. The veranda, much like the rest of the house, he suspected, was built for a family of shorter people.

Hesitating for a second, Francis produced a key and unlocked the front door. With Ricard's hand against his back, he swung the door open.

"Home sweet home," Francis said, stepping over the threshold.

The air inside was cold and damp, despite the summer sun. Francis coughed as their footsteps kicked up little clouds of dust from the hall carpet. Ricard walked silently just behind Francis. He felt like he was stepping into an abandoned museum, one dedicated to someone else's memories.

"Pat must have barely gotten started here," Francis said as they stepped into the living room. Ricard flicked a light switch, letting a cheap glass chandelier illuminate the room. "She said she wanted to pack up all the furniture and store it..." Francis trailed off, standing in the centre of the room.

"How are you-" Ricard began, but Francis interrupted him.

"This was her favourite spot," Francis said, pointing to a well-worn chintz armchair. "She always sat there to read." He ran a paw over the cloth, brushing tufts of dust to the floor. "It's the only place in the house where you get evening sun through a window at the right angle."

Ricard leaned against the doorway, observing quietly as Francis elaborated on the virtues of this particular armchair.

"You never answered my question," Ricard said. Francis sighed and fell silent.

"How do I feel?" Francis turned around. Specks of dust swirled in the air from the sudden appearance of people in the abandoned room. "I've felt better..." He said, casting his gaze down.

Ricard approached him, leaning down and wrapping his arms around the fox. Francis pressed himself against the taller human, closing his eyes as Ricard brushed his fingers through his plush fur.

Mona Barr occupied far more of the room than her short stature should allow. She was everywhere at once, and nowhere was this more apparent than her own kitchen. Francis sat down at the kitchen table and observed as his mother did the dishes, prepared lemonade and watered the plants at the same time as she vividly recounted her latest gardening endeavour. He had offered to help, but she had insisted that he sit down and relax. Apparently, he worked too hard.

"They make it so easy nowadays, I almost feel like I'm cheating!" Mona said, twirling around and placing a pitcher of fresh lemonade on the table. "When I was your age, I'd have to find someone to build it all for me, and it would cost a fortune. Now? I just ordered a kit and I can put together a greenhouse on my own!"

Francis nodded along with his mother's enthusiasm. While she went on about how painless mail ordering was, he studied the room. He hadn't visited in over a year, but the room was unchanged.

"Actually, I wanted to tell you something," Francis interjected when Mona paused to take a breath. She sat down next to him at the table, eyes wide and ears forward with interest. Francis smiled and poured a glass of lemonade. "I've met someone, and I think we're going to move in together."

Mona was silent for a moment, then her face cracked into a grin and she lunged at her son.

"My darling boy!" She threw her arms around Francis, who happily returned her embrace. She kissed him on the cheek and pulled back, face sparkling with excitement. "Who is he? What's his name?"

"His name's Ricard," Francis began. His face felt hot. He was happy to share the news, but telling your mother that you've met someone new always makes you feel like a teenager talking about their first crush. "He's a journalist at the *St. Carmen Daily*. We met when they were moving into their new offices downtown."

Mona stared intently at her son, paws fidgeting in her lap excitedly. Francis took a sip of lemonade and took out his phone.

"Do you want to see a picture?" He asked. His mother nodded instantly, craning her neck over to see the screen.

The image was of Francis and Ricard at a local beach. They were right next to each other, faces pressed tight together to fit in the frame. Francis knew that just below the picture, Ricard's arms held him up so their heads would be level with the camera. Francis wouldn't say it out loud, but Ricard knew he loved being held that way.

"What a handsome man," Mona said, squinting her eyes to get every detail she possibly could out of the picture. There was some surprise in her voice, but not the judgmental or unpleasant kind. She'd always thought her son would choose another fox, not a lanky human who distinctly lacked fur. Mona was long since at peace with not getting any grandchildren. Francis was gay, and Patricia seemed wholly uninterested in having children. Consequently, it didn't matter much to her what partner her son chose, she had no stake in the matter. She would have liked it if her children had seen the same joy in parenthood as she had, but Mona realised it was rather selfish to expect your children to conform to your expectations of *their* adulthood.

Francis swiped past yet more pictures of himself and Ricard, eagerly showing them to his mother. She drank in every one with the same enthusiasm, commenting on what a beautiful couple they made, how tall and handsome Ricard was, and how happy they looked together.

"I love him."

Mona went quiet, looking at Francis. It took him a minute to realise that his audience was no longer focused on the images he was showing, but on himself.

"I can tell," Mona said, laying an arm around her son. "You're no great mystery, Francis."

--

Francis had sold the homes of dead people before. Every case had been different, but the basic procedure never differed much. He would offer condolences and relate to whatever anecdote the family told him. Ultimately, it didn't matter much to his business.

Patricia had made all the paperwork ready, and to his eyes it was all prim and proper. But this wasn't any ordinary house. Any old widow can tumble down the steps one day and without much delay, the vultures would descend to pick apart the estate for anything of value. That, curiously, hadn't been the case here. There wasn't much of economical value to be found, but there weren't any vultures either.</br>
There's a special kind of loneliness to be found where a deceased person's belongings are left the way they are. Not even the base greed of all sentient beings calling out to anyone.

"Francis!" Ricard called from out on the porch. The voice was different, but Francis had been called out onto the porch before. Francis put down the papers and walked out the front door. Ricard had finally taken off his sunglasses and had located one of the wicker couches on the veranda. "Come sit down," He said, smiling and holding two glasses of clear liquid with ice. Gin, Francis correctly guessed.

After the scorching daytime heat, the evening air was a pleasant change of pace. Francis sat down on the couch and took the drink he was offered. Ricard had known to pack a respectable assortment of beverages. The nearest grocery store was an hour away, and Francis didn't recall their selection to be particularly inspiring.

"I feel like I should have something poignant to say," Francis said. He leaned against Ricard who ran a hand over his head, stroking the soft fur behind his rakish ears. It was all the response he needed.

They each drank from their glass, listening to the sounds around them. Throughout the garden, birds and crickets alike serenaded the arrival of the night.
