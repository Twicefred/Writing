# Innocent Blue - Chapter Two

## Chapter Outline

Ricard spends the day exploring the house and garden. He spends considerable time trying to access the attic, but the door is locked. Meanwhile, Francis drives to get groceries at the store an hour away. </br>
While Francis is away, Ricard finds an old photo album containing childhood pictures of Francis and his family. Tucked in behind one of the photos is an even older picture of Mona and Francis's father. The photograph is torn and only Mona's face is visible. Nevertheless, it yields some clues as to the nature of Francis's father. Without internet access however, they don't have many ways to do research. The two resolve to find the key to the attic, or break down the door if they can't find it within a day or two.
