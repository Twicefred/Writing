## The News 1

Francis sat back and smiled as the meeting ended. His boss gave him a wink and flashed a grin as he escorted their latest clients out of the conference room. With all the paperwork finalised, Francis had successfully shepherded a major furniture retailer to a flashy new corporate HQ by the waterfront.

## Hospital Scene 1

Francis slammed the car door behind him and hurried toward the hospital entrance. He'd parked across two spaces, but that wasn't on his mind. He stomped his paws against the snowy ground, cursing the slow automatic doors. The inside was empty save for a few unfortunate souls waiting for an appointment.

"I'm looking for Mona Barr," He said, approaching the reception. The tired nurse staffing the desk looked him over and pointed him toward a block of elevators.

"Room D54."

Francis nodded his thanks and walked to the elevators. Room D54. Fifth floor, fourth room in D corridor.

A sleepy janitor was mopping the floors when Francis walked past him. He had to take short steps to not slip on the wet floor.

Francis held his breath when he opened the door. The lights were turned off inside, but he didn't need them to know what was in front of him.

Patricia turned around to face her brother. Francis's heart sank as their eyes made contact. Neither said a word as Francis closed the distance between them and they embraced. Patricia's cheeks were wet with tears and she shivered as Francis hugged her tight.

"I'm so sorry, Pat," Francis said. He drew a ragged breath and blinked away the tears welling up in his eyes. "I drove as fast as I could, I didn't think I would..."

## Hospital Scene 2

Cold, fluorescent lights bathed the room with an icy glow from the corridor outside. The hospital machinery had been turned off, but their tubes and wires still ran across the floor and the bed in the middle of the room. Outside, the snow had given way to a light rain clattering against the windows.

"They're in here," A nurse said, opening the door from the outside. "There's an empty room next door if you need it." Ricard nodded his thanks to her and walked into the room.
