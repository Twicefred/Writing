Human medic saves Orc adventurer/mercenary(?). After nursing the Orc back to health, the Human follows him on his journey out into the wilderness. Story about coming-of-age, finding strength in different ways.

Orc - Garn. 33 y/o. 2.4m tall, dark green. Scars over his face and body, partially obscured by bright red hair.
    Garn makes his living as an adventurer and sometime mercenary. Like many Orcs, he's chosen a nomadic life, and hasn't much entertained the idea of settling down.
    Garn hails from a far away land. A significant chunk of his livelihood comes from entertaining tavern guests with tales of his homeland and the adventures he's had. Embellished or not, the crowds flock to hear what he has to say.

Orc - Thronn. 34 y/o. 2.45m tall, light green. Long, flowing black hair.
    Thronn is Garn's traveling companion, friend and sometime lover. He carries Garn to the temple when the other Orc is wounded, and while Garn is mending, he and Arvid get to know one another.

Human - Arvid. 22 y/o. 1.78m tall, light brown skin. Thick, curly dark hair.
    Arvid is a medic at the temple in Narvanberg, healing the wounded and comforting the sick. He has a clear magical aptitude, and the priests have taught him to harness it into potent healing spells and magical wards. However, he's never trained in or tried to use his talents for combat.
    When Garn and Thronn arrive at the temple, Arvid takes a special interest in the Orcs and stays by their side. A month later, when Garn is ready to leave, Arvid disobeys his superiors at the temple and leaves with the Orcs.

Together, Arvid, Garn and Thronn. travel through the wilderness, discovering each other in the process.

Arvid leaned back against the log whilst Garn stoked the fire. The moss beneath him was damp, but the fire soon warmed him up. Across the lake, he could just barely make out the lights of Narvanberg.

Garn sat down next to him, poking the fire with a stick and looking out over the water.

"This is the farthest away from home I've ever been," Arvid said. He looked up at the darkening sky, the moon and stars were just becoming visible.

"Unless you turn back tomorrow, you'll be able to say that every day," Garn said.

"You're not at the temple anymore," Garn said, propping himself up on an elbow and lifting the thick furs to make room for another. "It's your choice and I'll respect it, but don't say no because you're afraid of people who don't have any power over you any longer."

Arvid hesitated, but the cool night breeze caused the rest of his doubts to crumble. Garn supressed a triumphant grin as he held his arms open. Arvid shivered as he laid down on the bedding next to Garn, letting the Orc pull the fur cover over them.

"Don't be a stranger," Garn said in a low voice, laying an arm around Arvid's torso and bringing him closer. Arvid reflexively tried to push back, but relented almost immediately. Garn's warmth and comforting touch was quick to relax him, and Garn smiled as he felt Arvid melt against him. "Comfortable?" He asked, smiling as Arvid nodded slowly and rested his head against Garn's arm.

The only thing separating the two were the thin clothes they each wore to bed, and Arvid soon found himself breathing deep. Garn smelled of leather from his jerkin, and smoke from the fire, but more than that he smelled like a real man. Not the lavender-scented starched robe-wearing priests at the temple, but someone who could fight and work with his body. Someone who, Arvid thought as Garn's strong arm pressed their bodies together, would keep him safe.

It had become a habit. Every night after they ate, Garn would lie down by the fire and Arvid would soon be next to him. Garn knew that Arvid wouldn't be the one to initiate anything, but Arvid's behaviour was enough clue that his gradual advances were well received. Garn would hold Arvid's smaller body tight to his, and Arvid would relax into his embrace. Garn felt Arvid's soft breath against his skin, knowing that Arvid loved breathing in his presence.

It was a night by the Colloniad river when Garn decided to test the waters and go one step further. Arvid lay down next to him

"You didn't just come with us to see the world, did you?" Thronn said. He sat down next to Arvid. Garn was at the human's other side, fencing the shorter man in between the Orc's twin bodies.

"What do you mean?" Arvid answered in a small voice.

"You know what he means," Garn said, his hand dangerously close to Arvid's thigh.

"You've never felt the touch of another man," Thronn said. It wasn't a question. Arvid was entirely inexperienced, but even in his relative naïveté he knew where this situation was headed.

"No, I haven't," He gulped, flinching as Thronn's hand landed against his shoulder and the Orc's breath washed over the side of his face. Arvid was frozen in place as Thronn and Garn moved in on him. Their movements were perfectly synchronised, slowly covering Arvid's smaller body with their touch.

"We're going to show you the world, Arvid," Garn said, his mouth at Arvid's ear. He shivered as Garn flicked his tongue out, playfully touching the lobe of his ear and the tender flesh of his neck. "You're about to discover what you've been missing out on."

Arvid breathed out as the two pairs of hands stroked his body. Skilfully, the laces on his jerkin had been untied and his skin was exposed to the crisp evening air. A strong, calloused hand landed on his stomach, slowly rubbing him and making him feel warmer. Arvid turned his head and immediately Thronn was there. The Orc fixed his gaze and their lips met. Arvid knew the terrifying strength that Thronn could summon but the Orc was gentle, letting Arvid himself continue the kiss once the Human realised that it felt right.

"I could look at that all day," Garn said from behind, watching in delight as Arvid parted his lips and let Thronn deepen the kiss. They made out slowly, Arvid moaned out as Thronn pulled him closer. In his head, he could recall a myriad of lectures on denying yourself the profane pleasures of the flesh. They all seemed irrelevant now.

Thronn groaned as he felt Arvid relax against him. Behind Arvid he could see Garn smirking at them both. The other Orc had removed his jerkin and trousers, and his dark green skin glimmered in the dim firelight. Ever since he first laid eyes on Arvid at the temple, he'd imagined this moment. The three of them alone beneath the stars, two Orcs ready to teach their new lover just what his temple brothers had kept from him. Together, he and Garn would claim Arvid with the open skies as their witness. They'd only given Arvid small signals at the temple, just enough to gauge that the boy was interested after all. He thought he hid his hungry gazes well, but an experienced eye picked up on his true feelings.
