# Orc Compendium

## Physical Description;

Average Orc Male height; 2.2m</br>
Average Orc Female height; 2m

**Body**; Orcs have roughly the same body proportions as Humans, and consequently have larger heads, hands, feet etc relative to their larger size.</br>
**Skin**; Orcs have varying green skin. Much like Humans, their skin tone varies by ethnicity and geographical locale, ranging from bright lime green in the north to dark camouflage green closer to the equator.</br>
**Hair**; While different than in Humans, Orcs have similar variations in hair colour, though darker hair is more common. Blonde hair is the most uncommon, while bright red is the most common other than dark brown.</br>
**Teeth**; Orcs have sharper teeth and two to four prominent tusks on their lower jaw, generally rising up to 8cm at the tip. Longer outliers have been recorded. Many Orc cultures decorate both male and female tusks with piercings, burned patterns or other ornaments.</br>
**Ears**; Orcs have sharply tipped ears that rise taller than Human ears. This is believed to be an evolutionary relict and does not impact their sense of hearing.</br>
**Reproduction**; Orcs are mammals and reproduce in the same way as Humans do, though an Orc pregnancy runs for 11 months from conception to birth. Orc mothers nurse their children in the same way that Human mothers do, and children develop in roughly the same timeframe that Humans do. While Orcs and Humans are very similar in many regards, they are separate species and cannot interbreed.</br>
**Sexuality**; Orcs vary in sexuality and sexual expression in much the same ways that Humans do, though notably many majority Orc cultures are historically less hostile to non-heterosexuals.
Senses; While not as pronounced a difference as with other species, Orcs have noticeably keener senses of smell and hearing than Humans. Conversely, Humans on average enjoy better eyesight.
Due mainly to difference in body size, Humans also have a sharper sense of touch, especially in the hands.</br>
**Movement**; Because of their larger size, Orcs are much stronger than Humans. On average they are equally fast, though Humans have the capacity to remain on the move for much longer.
Orcs have slightly less refined fine motor skills than Humans, leading to workplaces and society at large often carrying two versions of most tools, machinery, appliances and control surfaces. For example, elevators often come equipped with two sets of floor buttons, varying in size and positioned at different heights.

## Cultural Discussion; 
Orcs and Humans developed distinct cultures and customs independently of one another, but since time immemorial the two species have coexisted and intermingled in society.
Inevitably, there have been instances where one group has turned on the other, and there are still today some issues of discrimination and unfair treatment owing to prejudice.

**Psychology**;

**Interspecies Relations**; In fully integrated societies, Humans and Orcs are educated from birth to be mindful and appreciative of each other’s differences and uniqueness. This manifests itself in a number of ways as the two species form complex relationships in cooperation and dependency on each other.</br>
Because of their size and strength, Orcs are taught from a young age to treat Humans gently, lest they accidentally cause harm.</br>
Quite commonly, Orcs are very protective (and sometimes quite possessive) of Humans they are close to. It is not unusual for Orcs to insist on doing more physically taxing work (carrying things, moving etc) for their Human friends. Conversely, Humans often help their Orc friends with jobs better suited to smaller hands (tying a tie, operating some machinery, hairdressing etc).</br>
While it varies depending in culture, Orcs show physical affection differently and more openly than Humans typically do among each other. In the vein of acting protectively, Orcs typically like to always be in physical contact with their Human friends when spending time together. This can range from holding hands or physically embracing, to carrying a close friend or partner in their arms.</br>
For many Orcs, hearing a Human they are fond of say that they make them feel safe is one of the greatest compliments one can receive.</br>
Conversely, most Humans know and appreciate that Orcs take pride in protecting those they care about.</br>

## Writing Notes;

Grammar; The word “Orc” is always capitalised, same as the word “Human”.</br>
While this isn’t proper English, I believe that in a world where two species coexist in the way I want to describe, there would be grammatical differences highlighting the fact that they are trying to get along whilst being mindful of each other’s differences.

Naming Conventions; Orcish names are commonly either patronymic or matronymic, depending on culture or family circumstance. In Europe and the Americas, Orc names are constructed with a given name first, followed by Ga’ (son of) or Da’ (daughter of) followed by either their mother’s or father’s given name.
