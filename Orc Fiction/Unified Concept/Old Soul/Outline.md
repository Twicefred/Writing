Characters and plot outline

Characters;

**Kronn Windsong** -- 25 y/o. Orc. 2,2m tall.\
Long, black hair, sometimes pulled into a ponytail.\
Medium dark green skin.\
Brown eyes.\
Thick, muscled build but with soft stomach and features.\
Works as a line cook at a lunch restaurant.

Kronn prefers to wear as little clothing as possible when home. He
prefers simple clothing, preferring tight-fitting t-shirts and jeans.

Kronn has two silver bands around his tusks, inscribed with TK. The
bands can be removed like rings when he files his tusks.

Kronn is the only son of a single mother who raised him after his father
died in an accident. Kronn was too young to remember his father.

Kronn has a sweet tooth, and works out to maintain his physique. Despite
this, he has a prominent gut.

Kronn's mother taught him from a young age to treat Humans gently, and
as a result he is a deeply protective and caring person. Particularly
when it comes to Daniel, but he extends this to others as well.

**Daniel McCoy** -- 22 y/o. Human. 1,78m tall.\
Medium length blonde hair, combed back.\
Fair skin.\
Blue eyes.\
Skinny build with some muscle definition.\
Worked in a record store when he met Kronn, but now works as IT-support
in an office building with several companies.

Daniel has less trouble with clothes than Kronn, and usually wears
long-sleeve shirts. He has low self-esteem about his body and is
hesitant to show the scars across his arms from self-harm.

Daniel comes from a deeply religious and abusive family, and carries
trauma from that experience. He regularly visits a therapist to deal
with this.

Daniel grew up being told that Orcs were similar to beasts in
intelligence and should be avoided, but being exposed to the internet
and by speaking to others his prejudices were challenged. When first
meeting Kronn, he was at first reticent to get close, but they quickly
warmed to each other.

Daniel is the youngest of three siblings. He has two older sisters who
follow in his parents' footsteps.

**Lorana Windsong** -- 48 y/o. Orc. 2m tall.\
Short, brown hair. Often styled upward, depending on mood.\
Dark green skin.\
Brown eyes.\
Slim build (relative to species).\
Works as an insurance lawyer.

Lorana is Kronn's mother, and has raised him alone since her husband
died in a car accident when Kronn was 2 years old.

Lorana misses her husband, but she is no longer in mourning. Her own
experience in dealing with loss helps her understand how Daniel feels
about his family.

Lorana has dated several men, but nothing long-term has stuck. She
frequently finds them to be "too weak" for her tastes, though she seldom
explains what that means.

**Charles McCoy** -- 60 y/o. Human. 1,78m tall.\
Bald.\
Fair skin.\
Blue eyes.\
Medium build.\
Manages a local chain of grocery stores.

Charles is Daniel's father. He is a devoutly religious man, and along
with his wife Mary regularly attend mass at TK Church.

Charles believes deeply in Human supremacy, and is against employing or
working with Orcs for any reason. This puts him at odds with his son,
and most other members of society.

Charles is a significant source of childhood trauma for Daniel (and
indeed for his other two children, who don't challenge him however). He
frequently beat his children, it is assumed he has done the same to his
wife.

**Mary McCoy** -- 58 y/o. Human. 1.65m tall.\
Blonde, graying hair. Usually tied in a bun.\
Fair skin.\
Green eyes.\
Slight build.\
Does accounting for her husbands stores.

Mary is Daniel's mother. She sees herself as a protective and nurturing
mother, but in reality she is often cold and distant. She frequently has
tried to manipulate her children for sympathy, which belies her nature
as a narcissist.
