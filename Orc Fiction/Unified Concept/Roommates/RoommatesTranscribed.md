Roommates transcribed

It's one of those moments you read about but don't expect actually
happen. Like, even if there are some people who certainly get off to
some special stuff, that's not something you can be coerced into.

You'd never been into anything more than the equivalent of cheap vanilla
ice cream, to the extent that you were "into" anything at all. Sex was
always a sinful exercise but to not procreate was ungodly. The youth
pastors had always taught you to leave space for Jesus when dancing, and
you'd taken them at their word. Nothing sinful here, no sir.

Of course, your piety had been tested time and again since leaving home.
Your parents rules had been clear: no female roommates, no dating, no
alcohol. Not that any of those rules were particularly hard to follow on
their own, it's just that there were so many who seemed determined to
lead you into sin and misery.

The devil came in many shapes and sizes, and you had no doubt he had
more temptations in store for you.
