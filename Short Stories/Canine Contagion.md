# Canine Contagion

*Be careful what you read on the internet; it might lead to exploring your sexuality.*

“Sorry you had to see that,” You say, slumping down on the couch and turning the TV on. Your date – hookup, really – had just slammed the front door behind him as he left.

“What got into him?” Mikey, your husky roommate, says as he sits down next to you. The cushions tilt in his direction as his bulk settles against the furniture.

“I don’t know anymore, I think I’m unfuckable.”

“Do you want a hug?” He says, his blue eyes fixed on yours. He’s only half-joking, his ears splayed low in concern. You nod and he scoots closer.

You hang your head as he embraces you. He smells fresh. Mikey always uses the same shampoo, some faintly lavender scented brand that you can never remember the name of. You relax and hug him back. His plush, white fur is so soft against your face, it really makes you forget that you were just dumped before the first date even got started.

“Don’t let rejection get to you.” That seems like a tall order to you, but it’s probably good advice. “And don’t call yourself unfuckable, it’s not true.” You both laugh, your mood lightening somewhat.

“How would you know, I thought you were straight?”

“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I was born yesterday,” He says, releasing you from his arms.

“Thanks, I feel a bit better now,” You say, sitting back on the couch. “You going out tonight or staying in?” Your evening plans had just been cancelled, but Mikey hadn’t mentioned his.

“Going out, I’m meeting Laureen for dinner,” He says, tail wagging at the thought of his night to come. Laureen. The lioness with the piercing green eyes and a swing in her steps that said ‘I don’t take shit from anyone’. She was nice enough, you thought. Ever so slight bitterness that she occupies so much of your best friend’s time, but he has his life and you have yours. Shame you can’t spend more of them together.

“Well, make sure you stay safe, loverboy.” You nudge his side with your elbow. Lately the news had been full with stories of a new sexually transmitted virus. If the reports were to be believed, it had some nasty symptoms. Screwed with your head in weird ways. Not a problem for you. After all, you were decidedly unfuckable.

“Laureen and me have been going steady for months, bro. I’m not worried about any diseases.” Mikey swishes his ears back and forth, perhaps slightly annoyed at your joke but not enough to counter it.

“Well, *bro*. You enjoy your evening,” You say as he stands up from the couch. The springs tilt you back from where he sat, catching you off-balance. “Say hi to Laureen from me.”

“Will do,” He says. Soon, he’s pulled on a shirt and he leaves.

You’re left sitting on the couch. Nothing good is on TV, and your game library doesn’t seem very appealing. The evening passes slowly. You eat ramen for dinner. There’s proper food in the fridge, but you can’t be bothered to cook.

Eventually you end up at your computer, browsing the same websites you’ve seen a million times. So, you do what men everywhere do when they’re bored and lonely: you unzip your pants and open a porn site.

‘This looks good,’ You think, clicking on a video. ‘Jimothy and the Big Bad Wolf’. The title is kind of fetishizing, which makes you uncomfortable, but the content itself seems hot. You’ve got Jimothy, a little human twink, lying bashfully in a hotel bedroom, waiting for his lover. The lover, you notice, isn’t actually a wolf at all. It’s shot from behind, so it takes you a moment, but when the camera pans around you realise that the large canine is a husky. With a striking resemblance to Mikey.

‘Oh fuck,’ You think, watching the video play. It’s hot, sure. Still, it can’t be healthy to jack off to someone this similar to your best friend. But no one is perfect, so you do it anyway.

“My, what a big dick you have,” The human porn actor moans. You cringe so hard you can’t even hear the husky respond. Do you really need to hear that, anyway?

They make out aggressively as the husky spears the human on his dick. ‘*Fuck I wish that was me,*’ You think. Definitely not healthy.

Jimothy whimpers as the Big Bad Wolf – or husky, whatever – pushes his knot against his tight little hole. It looks like an impossible fit, but you know from personal experience that it can be done. The human wails in pleasure as the canine slams forward, the massive flesh bulb slipping home. You come all over yourself as you watch Jimothy get tied. The human’s stomach is bulging from the massive husky cock pumping him full of seed.

As the video fades to black, you’re left sitting in front of a blank screen. You can faintly see your reflection in the monitor. You feel sad. Not like you’re going to cry or anything, you’re just acutely aware of how lonely you feel. How lonely you are.

You go to bed early. There doesn’t really seem to be any good reason to stay up. As you fall asleep your thoughts briefly wander to what Mikey’s getting up to. Or rather, what he’s getting up inside.

## Break

You’re having breakfast when Mikey gets home the next morning. Between spoonfuls of cereal, you study him as he very slowly walks in the door and takes off his coat.

“Someone had fun yesterday,” You say. He doesn’t respond, his blue eyes shooting daggers at you. He looks like he’s been in a cage match with a lion, which might be a fair assessment of his night. Between the matted fur and clumsy movements, you can tell he’s Hungover with a capital H.

“I’m going to bed again,” He says, his claws clicking against the tile floor as he drags himself through the kitchen to his bedroom.

“Do you want something? Drink? Food? Painkillers?”

“I just need to sleep for a while, but thanks,” He says, closing the door behind him.

And he does. For the next twenty-four hours. You occupy yourself with binging the latest season of ‘*Bachelorettes on Ice*’, but when the next morning comes and Mikey still hasn’t left his room you begin to worry.

Opening the door to his bedroom, you’re immediately hit with a wall of stale air. It smells like a locker room, if the entire rugby team got drunk at the same time.

Mikey is sprawled out on top of his bed. The covers are on the floor next to the bed. You can’t tell if they’ve fallen off or if he never pulled them on in the first place. What you can tell, however, is that he’s naked as the day he was born.

“Fuck,” You mutter under your breath. You’re lucky that he’s asleep, because your pants are feeling tight. You’ve seen him naked before, but not like this. His strong, muscular legs are spread wide, letting his fat sheath rest against one of his thighs. His balls are like two fur-covered grapefruits, laying heavy against the bed. No wonder the room smells like it does.

Remembering why you’re in here in the first place, you pinch yourself to get some sense back into your thick skull. You might be attracted to Mikey, but he’s very straight. And you can’t just ogle your friends, it’s not polite.

“Hey, Mikey,” You say, walking over a pile of discarded clothes on the floor. He doesn’t move, still fast asleep. “Hey, wake up.” You grab his shoulder and shake. Still nothing. You briefly contemplate leaving him to sleep, but he’s been cooped up for ages and you feel concerned.

“Mikey!” You say, louder this time. You finally get a reaction. Drawing a ragged breath, the big husky opens his eyes and looks up at you.

“What is it?” He drawls, eyes half-lidded.

“Are you okay? You don’t seem well.”

“I’m just hungover,” He says, closing his eyes again.

“Mikey, you can’t have a hangover this bad for this long,” You say, folding your arms. “I’ll bring you some water, you need to hydrate.”

He nods slowly. You fill a jug of water in the kitchen and bring it to his room. He lifts his big head off the pillow and you just pour the water down his muzzle, like bottle-feeding a baby animal. Except the animal is twice your size. Mikey drinks down the entire jug of water before crashing down on the pillow again.

“Do you want me to call a doctor?” You ask, leaning over him. “You don’t look so good.”

“No…” He grumbles, waving you off with one his paws. “Just a cold or something.”

“Alright, I’ll check in on you later. Just yell if you need anything,” You say, backing out of the room. You leave the door open, airing the place out might do him some good.

It’s Sunday, so you busy yourself with some chores you’ve been neglecting lately. You clean the kitchen and the bathroom. The TV is on in the background, cable news blaring as you mop the floor. At some point, Mikey drags himself out of bed to go to the bathroom. He seems really out of it. ‘*Just a cold, my ass,*’ You think, putting away the cleaning supplies in the closet.

“A new study concludes that some species show greater resistance to the virus. Doctors recommend that canines and equines in particular take extra precautions.” You turn to the TV, watching as the news anchors discuss the recent developments. “In related news, the government is deploying extra resources to make at-home testing available for free. Check in with your doctor for more info. Now onto Douglas with this week’s weather forecast.”

The TV turns over to the weather map just as Mikey walks out of the bathroom. He makes a little wave towards you and then slinks back into his bedroom.

Mikey had dismissed the thought earlier, but there is a virus being spread and according to the TV people he’s showing symptoms. Soon, you’re on the government health website ordering a testing kit.

It’s available for free, but you decide to pay up for same-day delivery. The test is a throat swab that you dip in a liquid, and if it turns pink you’ve tested positive. Great. You’ve always wanted to get deep in his throat anyway.

A little later, Mikey emerges from his room. You’re stretched out on the sofa watching some daytime soap opera when he walks over.

“How’re you feeling?” You ask, looking up at him as he looms over you.

“Like shit,” He says. You begin to reply but the wind is knocked out of you as he crashes onto the couch, and you.

“Fucking smell like it, too,” You say, barely managing to get a word out. He’s draped on top of you, completely covering your body. His big head is just below yours and you feel his wet nose against your throat. “You’re really not OK, are you?”

Mikey shakes his head. With his ears almost flat against his skull and those blue eyes piercing yours, he looks pitiful. You manage to dislodge one of your arms from beneath him and bring it up to his head. His fur is almost greasy, saturated with old sweat. Dogs didn’t need to shower as often as humans, but Mikey is way overdue at this point.

You gently run your fingers over his head, scratching behind his ears. He seems to appreciate this, his tail moving a bit in response. He breathes heavily against your throat and you’re starting to feel warm from his heavy body covering yours. Mikey has always been clingy, but now he seems more touch starved than you’ve ever seen him.

“At least you’re out of bed. In a manner of speaking.”

“Keep doing that,” Mikey says. You comply, scratching behind his ear again. You wonder what that feels like. It must be different for him, your ears aren’t that sensitive.

“Feel better now?”

“Yeah, this is nice,” He says, snuggling into you.

You stay like that for a long time. Mikey seems to have gotten some energy back into his body, and soon you’re laughing together, making fun of the unbelievable sitcom characters currently on TV.

Just as one of the shows ends, you hear something fall through the letterbox onto the hall carpet. With considerable difficulty, you wiggle out from underneath the enormous husky to check what had arrived. It’s a small package, addressed to you with various official stamps and seals on it.

Mikey looks up from the couch and you motion for him to come over.

“What’s this?” He asks, tilting his head to read the writing on the envelope.

“It’s a testing kit for that new virus, I ordered it online.” Mikey looks weird at you. You open the envelope and take out a plastic bag. “You never know. If it’s just a cold, it will come out negative and we’ll move on with our lives. But if it’s positive you need to know.”

“This is dumb,” Mikey says as you hold up the testing kit. “When that thing comes out negative, I’ll tell you in more detail just how dumb it is.”

“It doesn’t hurt to know for sure,” You say, tearing open the plastic packaging. Inside is a set of cotton swabs and a tube of viscous liquid.

“So, how does this work?” Mikey looks on as you read the instructions.

“Well, first step is you opening wide for me,” You say, brandishing the long cotton swab.

“Can’t I do this myself?” Mikey asks, but he complies with your instructions. He has to bend his knees for you to reach properly.

“You’re sick, you might hurt yourself. Watch those chompers.” Mikey grins as you run the cotton swab through his muzzle and down to his throat. To his credit, he doesn’t gag. ‘Impressive for a straight guy,’ you think.

“Okay, now what?”

“Now we put it in this liquid and see what happens.” You unscrew the provided tube and immerse the cotton swab in the thick, oily liquid. Nothing happens.

“See? I told you how dumb this was. It’s a sexually transmitted disease, dude. You can’t just catch it like the common cold. Laureen is going to find this hilarious when I tell her. Besides, that virus does shit to your head, and I’m the same I’ve always been.” Mikey continues to babble on, but your eyes are focused on something else.

“Mikey, look at this,” You say, holding the test tube in front of his eyes. The liquid is very clearly turning pink.

Mikey doesn’t say anything, he just looks at the test tube. You’re tempted to make fun of him, but he’s clearly quite shaken, so you put the test back into the packaging and stand quietly.

“Well, that’s just because…” Mikey looks down on the floor, nervously scratching at his chest. “I’m going to take a shower.” He turns his back to you and walks off toward the bathroom. You decide that it’s best to give him space, so you retreat to your room. You sit down by your computer and decide to do some research.

The news has been filled with reports on the virus, but they’ve been fairly nondescript on the symptoms other than describing them as flu-like. That, however, doesn’t completely jive with the stories you’ve read about how it’s affected people’s behaviour. After finding the government info unsatisfactory, you turn to a more colourful source: social media.

Soon, you’re reading stories from people who’ve tested positive for the virus. One man says he stopped loving his wife, another one talks about how he went into a deep depression. There are a lot of first- and second-hand accounts on how people have been changed by the virus. You don’t really believe all of them, but there certainly seems to be more to this disease than the media lets on.

You send a few of the links to Mikey, thinking he might look at them later. He might as well know what’s going on.

## Break

The next day is weird. You check your phone in the morning, and you see that Mikey has read the links you sent to him. He has read receipts on. You can’t understand why.

Mikey is already up when you walk into the kitchen, and he pours you a bowl of cereal and oat milk. You eat breakfast together, making idle conversation over the morning news. He’s sitting close to you, and when you eventually end up on the sofa, he puts his arm around you. You don’t comment on it, but he’s continuing a trend of being awfully clingy.

The day passes by uneventfully. Neither of you are working that day, so you’re both staying in. Mikey follows you around like a shadow. You decide to test him a bit, so you sit down in the kitchen for a while. Sure enough, he’s next to you in a flash.

That evening, you finally broach the subject.

“Are you okay?” You ask. He’s draped halfway over you on the sofa while you’re trying to play a video game. “You’ve been all over me the entire day, are you getting weird from that virus?”

“I don’t feel weird,” He says, face very close to yours. You feel his hot breath against your cheek.

“You’re acting kinda strange,” You say, turning your head to look at him. You’ve never seen that look in his eyes before.

“I feel just fine. You’re looking really nice right now.” His nose is against your throat, the entirety of his body pressing up against yours. This really can’t be happening. You try to move away, but he’s got you cornered.

“Mikey, this isn’t you,” You protest, pushing his muzzle away. He just gets back in your face, treating it like a game. He’s so much bigger than you, you can’t really fight back effectively. “You’re straight, this isn’t who you are.”

“I know what being straight is like,” He says, his long tongue dragging up the side of your face. He growls in delight at your taste. “This is nothing like that.”

“It’s because of the virus, you’re not supposed to be like this,” You say. He’s got your arms pinned to your sides, his muscular form descending over yours. “When this has passed, you’ll be back to normal, we just need to wait for that.”

“I know you want me,” He says, those eyes of his fixed on yours. You’re a deer in the headlights, every muscle in your body is frozen. “I can smell it on you, every day. You think you’re discreet. Never saying anything, but I’ve always known.” He growls deep. He’s a predator who’s got his prey where he wants it. “I can give you what you want. Don’t you want to find out if it’s as good as you think?” His muzzle is right at your ear, whispering to you. He’s nothing if not seductive, but you can’t let this go any further.

“Stop!” As hard as you can, you drive your knee up against his stomach. He wasn’t expecting that. He rolls off the sofa, holding his belly. You quickly clamber over the couch cushions, putting the furniture between you. “You have to stop this. Now. You’re fucked up from a disease, and I’m not some toy that you can just satisfy your urges with!” You’re almost shaking in anger. Mikey sits back against the coffee table, his ears low against his head.

“I’m sorry,” He says, looking down onto the floor.

“Yeah, ok. Maybe I do find you attractive? That doesn’t give you the right to treat me like this,” Mikey doesn’t respond as you chastise him. “What are you going to do when this is over and you go back to your girlfriend? ‘*Oops, guess I was just delusional, sorry I treated you like a cheap whore*’.”

“I would never do that to you,” Mikey says. His eyes are watering. You don’t doubt his sincerity in the moment, but you have to put your foot down.

“We can talk about this later,” You say, leaving him on the floor. You lock yourself in your room for the rest of the evening. At some point, Mikey knocks on the door and asks to be let in, but you ignore it.

## Break

You don’t talk to each other for the next two days. It’s an eerie feeling when your apartment, usually filled with music and laughter, is dead silent.

On the third day, you resolve to do something about it.

“Can I come in?” You knock on the doorframe to his room. Mikey is stretched out on the bed, headphones in his ears.

“Of course,” He says, popping the earphones out.

You sit down in his PC chair, swivelling it around to face him. It’s too high for you, so your feet dangle a bit above the floor. For a moment, you’re both quiet.

“I’m sorry for what I did,” Mikey says. He sits up on the bed, scooting closer to you. “It was fucked up to jump you like that. Will you forgive me?” He’s on his knees at the foot of the bed, paws in his lap.

“It’s okay. I forgive you,” You say, meeting his eyes. You can’t stay angry at him, and you can tell that his apology is sincere.

“Friends again?” Mikey asks, holding his arms open. You nod and jump off the chair, walking into his arms. You hug each other tight. He smells like lavender and you think to yourself that it’s a miracle this whole affair didn’t end up worse than it did.

You end up next to each other on his bed. He holds your face in one of his paws, the soft pads cushioning you like a pillow.

“I dumped Laureen.” Mikey’s eyes don’t meet yours when he talks.

“Because she infected you?” While you understand him being angry, it’s not like you can control a disease.

“It’s transmitted sexually. I didn’t give it to her, how do you think she got it in the first place?”

“Oh, I see…”

“Turns out she was more than just friends with one of her old classmates.”

“I’m sorry to hear that.” You’re terrible at consoling people, so you don’t say anything else.

“I don’t think we could have stayed together anyway,” Mikey says. He’s talking slowly, weighing each word carefully. “Even if she wasn’t a cheating bitch, things have changed.”

“What do you mean?” You look at each other. It seems like he’s gotten closer while talking. “Wait, you’re not talking about…” Your voice trails off. His eyes are fixed on yours. It feels like they’re glowing. “Mikey, if this is a joke, it’s not a very funny one.”

“I’m not joking.” Fuck. When did the room get this hot? He looks away for a moment, you can see his tail wagging behind him. “I’ve fucked this up once already.” Understatement of the year. “Will you give me a chance to do it right?”

You nod. Your breath is stuck in your throat as your faces move closer. He really wasn’t joking.

It’s like fireworks when your lips finally meet. It’s a bit awkward, clearly neither of you are very experienced. You open your mouth and his tongue unfolds into you, filling your mouth. You’re lying on your sides, so his open muzzle is drooling onto the bed, but you don’t care about that.

Mikey pulls you close, one paw on the back of your head as you make out. You can hear the thumping of his tail against the covers behind him. He’s so soft, it’s like being surrounded by a cloud. You end up on top of him, your face against his chest.

“So… How does this change feel? I guess you’ve shaken the virus by now.” You run your fingers through the soft mane of fur around his neck. You could bury your face in there for hours, he’s so warm and beautiful.

“I don’t know, really,” He says. His arms are around you, holding you on top of him. “I do feel different, but at the same time not really. Maybe something’s always been there and this brought it out? I can’t really explain it.”

You don’t say anything in response, just concentrating on being close to him. It feels bittersweet. Yes, you’ve wanted this for a long time. But what if it’s temporary? What if it’s just a fluke or some weird limited effect of a disease you don’t understand?

“You’re very quiet.” Mikey tilts his head down to look at you. “When I said I wouldn’t just throw you away, I meant that.” He flicks his tongue out to lick your nose and you smile back at him.

“Sorry, I think I’m adjusting to the idea.”

“I’ve had these thoughts for a long time. Just curiosity, really. We’ve been around each other for so long, I didn’t think it was more than that. Then I started dating Laureen, and I didn’t pay any attention to it.” Mikey runs his paws over your back and through your hair, his dull claws scratching at your skin. You start to understand why he likes it so much when you scratch his ears. “Then, with all this shit going on, I just saw you. Like, for the first time. In a different light. And it just clicked for me.”

“Hell of a way to have that happen,” You say, your hands playing with the fluffy fur around the bottom of his ears. “How long have you known…” You pause for a moment, letting the question marinate in your head. “That I was interested?”

“A few years now,” Mikey says, hugging you close. “You never brought it up, so I didn’t want to either. I just noticed you looking, and sometimes you acted differently when I was around. And you always hated my girlfriends.”

“I was right about this latest one,” You reply. He laughs and you join him.

“But more than anything I just had a gut feeling. I could just tell that something else was on your mind.” His paws are running down your back, feeling you up. “I guess I’m being forward again, but are you, like, interested? Now?” He tilts his head down to look at you. The angle is comical but you get the gist. You hadn’t come in here with those feelings at all, but now they were all bubbling up.

“You’re not wasting any time, are you?” You ask, he grins back at you. He grabs your head in his paws and pulls you in for a kiss again. He’s more aggressive this time, letting his tongue explore your mouth and face. You’re certainly not complaining.

Your lips stay connected as you slowly sit up on the bed. You only slip away when you both jump off. Mikey’s taking his shirt off, leering down at you in excitement. You follow his lead, unbuttoning your shirt.

“I guess I’m a beginner here,” Mikey says. He’s got his pants off already. It’s hard for you to look away. “I’ve got a captive audience, at least.” He winks at you. You blush, busying yourself with unbuttoning your shirt.

“It feels different when you’re actually supposed to look.” You’ve got your shirt and pants off, standing in front of Mikey in your underwear. You’ve been with guys who have been bigger than you before, but the sea of white fur in front of you is imposing in a whole new way. You step out of your briefs, and now you’re both naked.

“How do you want to…” He trails off, looking at you, then just past you.

“I don’t think it’s terribly different to being with a lady,” You say, making him laugh. “The equipment is different, sure, but I imagine the main principle is the same.”

“And what principle would that be?”

“Enjoy each other.” You step forward, reaching your arms up to his neck. He leans down and you kiss again. His paws are against the small of your back, pulling you into him. You’re rapidly growing hard as you feel his thick sheath press against your skin. You’ve spent too much time imagining how this moment would feel, and now it’s finally here.

He’s so gentle, letting you be in complete control of the tempo. Compared to his earlier display of masculine bravado, this is a completely different person. You can tell he’s never kissed a human before. His tongue runs slowly through your mouth, he’s exploring as much as he is making out with you. He’s also slobbering all over your face, but you won’t hold that against him. The wildly differing anatomy makes that inevitable.

You run your hands down his sides, combing them through his luxurious fur. You could really get used to this feeling. Stopping at his waist, you smile as he realises where you’re going. You grasp his sheath with both hands, feeling the soft, fur-covered flesh. It makes this odd, squishy sound and you realise he’s already pumping out precum, despite his dick not being fully out yet. Fuck, that’s hot.

“That feels good,” He says, gritting his teeth as you massage his sheath and balls. They look like they can produce quite a lot, hopefully you’ll get to see exactly how much. You see the tip of his dick poke out from his sheath, drooling a fat stream of precum. You fall to your knees in front of him. It feels slightly surreal to finally be where you’ve wanted to be for such a long time.

You stick your tongue out, laying the very end of it against the tip of his cock. Immediately, you feel a thick drip of pre spurt into your mouth. It tastes sweet, but still masculine. You dig forward, running your tongue into his sheath. It’s filled with his precum, which you greedily slurp up. You’ve never felt sluttier than now, but Mikey sure doesn’t mind. His legs are shaking as you press your entire face against his crotch. You feel his cock swelling against your tongue, and you push back against his sheath, helping him out.

‘Shit, he’s huge,’ You think. The massive spire of glowing, red meat that emerges is nothing short of extraordinary. It’s dripping with his juices. All for you.

Running your hands across his growing dick, you plant your face against his balls. You inhale deeply, letting those furred orbs cover your face. ‘Holy shit,’ You think, your mind reeling from the scent he emits. Letting your tongue run over his nuts, you imagine this is the way the word ‘manly’ should be described in the dictionary.

“Hang on, stop for a minute,” Mikey pants from above. You pull back, worried that you’ve done something wrong. “You’re going to get me off too fast like this.”

“I’ll take that compliment,” You say, flicking your tongue against his wildly throbbing cock. You’re instantly rewarded with a drop of husky precum into your mouth. Delicious.

“Yeah, but you haven’t let me touch you yet.” Oh right, he did mention he was actually attracted to you as well. Awkward.

Mikey gently pushes you backward and you get on his bed behind you. You’re so fucking hard, you could cum from him just looking at you.

“Do you, uh… Do you want some coaching?” You can’t help but laugh as he rolls his eyes at you.

“I think I know the basic gist of how this is done,” Mikey says, getting on his knees in front of you. For a brief moment, you’re concerned about those fangs of his, but that thought quickly evaporates. His tongue lolls out to caress your tightly drawn nuts. It feels so good. You’ve had sex after being pent up before, but nothing compares to this. It’s like you’ve taken a serum that’s gotten you exponentially more sensitive.

“You sure this is your first time?” You moan out loud as he coils his long tongue around your dick, squeezing and sucking it at the same time. You didn’t know that was possible. You’re tightly gripping the sheets below you, trying to hang on as he fellates you. Mikey doesn’t break eye contact with you for a second. He just mercilessly works his maw over your cock and balls. You whimper and he pulls back, sensing that you’re about to climax. “You fucking tease.” You pant as he grins at you, his tongue hanging out of his muzzle.

He climbs onto the bed beside you, his paw hefting your balls while his face glides up to yours.

“So, I know you’ve talked a bit about how two dudes do it before, but I was wondering-”

“Yeah, you’re going to fuck me,” You interrupt him. No point in stringing this out, the poor, confused, formerly-straight boy clearly needs direction. His eyes go wide before he laughs along with you.

“I have my orders, then,” He says, leaning in to kiss you. As you slurp on his tongue, your eyes drift down his body. You’re going to need some preparation before he can do you. You really don’t want to ask if any of the women he’s been with have let him put his manhood up their ass, but you’re hoping that’s the case. Luckily, you have some amount of experience in this area, so you can guide him along.

You feel his paw wandering lower on your body, running over your taint down to your ass. You breathe in sharply as you feel his large paw spread your cheeks wide.

“Relax, I’ll make sure you’re nice and ready,” He says. “Oh, don’t give me that look.” He laughs as you’ve obviously been caught off guard. “Just because I’m inexperienced here doesn’t mean I don’t know the basics.”
“I’m glad to hear it,” You say, saving face by kissing him again.

“Now if I’m not mistaken, I’ve got a job to do.” Mikey pulls away from you, running his tongue down your naked body as he slides lower. You shiver as he passes by your throbbing dick, but he goes lower. You spread your legs for him, and he accepts the invitation.

“Oh fuck,” You moan as his fat tongue runs down your ass. One moment it’s flexible, the next it’s stiff and poking against your tight hole. That tongue of his is rapidly becoming one of your favourite things in the world. He licks the entirety of your crack again and again, each time pressing inward a bit more. Mikey growls as you begin to open up for him, and soon he spears the tip of his tongue into your hole. You whimper as your insides fan open for him, gladly accepting the intrusion. A few short days ago you were pining for a love that couldn’t be, now prince charming was eating your ass like a buffet table. Amazing how things turn out sometimes.

His tongue is so big, and he uses it so well. For a straight man he’s very keyed into the exact location of your prostate, and he hits it with unnerving precision. Your cock pulses against your stomach, resting in a puddle of your own precum as Mikey has you more riled up than you’ve ever been.

You lose track of time, but he must’ve been rimming you for more than fifteen minutes. When he finally pulls his maw back from your ass, you’re gaping open.

“Ready for me?” He asks, climbing back onto the bed. His cock sticks out like a sore thumb on his body. A scarlet, angry weapon against his snow-white fur.

“Yeah, I’m ready,” You say, feeling his paws on your hips. He turns you over onto your stomach, and you rise up on your knees. You look back at him, grinning. “We’re really doing it doggy-“ He grits his teeth and pushes forward, shutting you up.

“What was that?” You moan in response as he pushes forward, sheathing more and more of his thick cock inside you. Fuck, this is everything you’ve ever wanted. You would cry if you weren’t so occupied with how amazing his dick felt. He prepared you well, and he slides in and out with ease. Your face is against the mattress, you can’t really be bothered to hold your front up. Mikey lowers his body down on top of yours, resting just enough of his weight on your back to feel good.

“Does this feel nice?” He murrs against your ear, his tongue playing against your cheek and earlobe. You whimper as the tip of his cock pushes against your prostate, making your dick throb violently. He slides his arms below you and pushes you down against the bed. You’re not going anywhere.

His fur is so soft against your back, it feels surreal to be in this position. You feel his hot breath against your neck as he saws that wonderful doggy dick in and out of you. You’ve had canines before, but Mikey is the biggest one by far.

“Oh fuck, please…” You groan as he angles his hips to drive his cock perfectly against your prostate. At some point you have to ask him how he became such a skilled top with this limited experience, but right now you can’t think that far ahead, you have to live in the moment.

He begins to fuck you harder, sliding more of his considerable length in and out of you with every thrust. Your breathing comes in ragged, short spurts as Mikey tenderises your innards. In the corner of your mind, you’re vaguely aware of a large presence at the base of his dick that’s starting to press insistently against the rim of your hole.

“So, gonna need an answer to this pretty quick,” Mikey says, his tongue rolling out of his maw as he drives his hips against your ass. “You okay with taking it all?” He underscores his point by pressing his growing knot against your hole. It’s a daunting prospect already, and soon it would be impossible to take.

“God, yes,” You moan. There’s really no question in your mind. You can deal with the soreness tomorrow. “Just fucking tie me already.”

“Music to my ears,” Mikey growls and pulls back. First, you think that he’s going to reposition you, but he’s just getting himself ready. Then, you get to feel the terrifying power in those leg muscles of his. Mikey pummels his hips against you. Your mouth is open in a silent scream as your hole expands to accommodate the enormous knot. When it slips in, it pushes you over the edge.

“Oh, fuck me Mikey,” You cry out, tears streaming down your face. The enormous husky dick pushes perfectly against your prostate, and your dick erupts completely untouched. You’ve never felt an orgasm this strong. Spots of white appear on your vision as Mikey humps against you in short strokes. By now you must be completely ruined for other men. Your seed pours out in one continuous stream against the covers. You can practically feel Mikey’s grin above you as he makes you cum without touching yourself even once.

“My turn now,” He says, rapidly stroking what little he can move of his dick. The massive knot has you tied together, and you feel his maw against your neck as his cock swells and throbs inside you. He bites down just a little bit, enough for his fangs to push threateningly against your soft flesh. You know he’s marking you. And then, you feel the floodgates burst inside you.

Mikey throws his head back, howling in ecstasy as his seed fills you. Wave after wave pours into your guts. A loving warmth filling every inch of your being. Mikey lifts your hips slightly off the bed, angling himself downward. You can feel his massive balls throb and contract as he breeds you. You’re truly marked as his bitch now.

Mikey rolls you onto your side as his orgasm continues unabated for well over a minute. By the end, you feel a sizeable bulge in your stomach. It’s like carrying a football filled with scalding hot liquid. And he’s still cumming into you. His breath is hot and heavy against your neck as smaller waves of canine seed push into you every few seconds.

“I feel so full,” You say, smiling as Mikey lovingly rubs your bulging stomach. You’re tied together for the next hour at least, and he lets you rest your head on his soft bicep.

“That was something else,” He says, snuggling up against your back. Your legs intertwine, his paws playing with your feet.

“Yeah, my ass is world class,” You quip. Laughing feels a bit weird when you’re filled with his cum and still plugged tight, but you’ll take it.

“So is the rest of you,” Mikey says, licking the side of your face. You blush, relaxing into his embrace. “You can’t really go anywhere for a bit. Do you want to watch a movie or something?”

“I’m fine with whatever,” You shrug. “Honestly, I just want to stay like this forever.” You choke up a bit on the last part. You’ve dreamed about this for so long, and it’s finally come true.

“I can’t promise you forever, but I’ll try my best,” Mikey says. He reaches behind him and pulls the covers over you. His arms pull you tighter against his strong chest as he spoons you. “I promise we’ll get as close as we can.”

## Break


“You’ve tested negative. Both of you.”

You look at Mikey in disbelief. The nurse looks at you both. It seems like you’re not the first people she’s had to deal with who are surprised with the result.

“That can’t be right,” Mikey says, leaning over the counter. “See, I used to be with a woman, but now I like men too.” You feel your cheeks burning and you see the nurse trying very hard not to laugh. “And this virus, it does stuff with your head.”

“I don’t know what you boys have read on the internet,” The nurse says. “But there’s no virus on this planet that can change your sexuality.” She pats Mikey on the arm. “You just realised something about yourself, there’s no need to involve the field of medicine in this.”

“But I had the symptoms, and my ex infected me,” Mikey protests. You turn your back to the spectacle. This is dirty laundry you really didn’t need aired in public.

“Let me guess, you did an at-home test too?” Mikey nods. “Those are notoriously unreliable, honey. She probably just gave you a bad cold.” The nurse smiles and signs the test documents, confirming you’ve both tested negative.

You walk out from the hospital together. It’s not a long walk back to your apartment.

“So, how does that result make you feel?” You ask, looking up at Mikey walking beside you.

“Like an idiot, to be honest,” Mikey answers. “That virus was a good story, now I’m just plain bisexual.” You walk silently for a block. “Then again, it’s still a good result. I’ve got you from it.” He holds your hand in one of his paws. You might not have the supernatural love story you thought you did, but this is still pretty nice.
