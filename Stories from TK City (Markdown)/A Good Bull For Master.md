# A Good Bull For Master

“Have you been a good bull for me?”

Angus struggled against the restraints. The heavy chains jingled against the metal lattice above, but held. He slumped back down into the harness. There was no way for him to get out.

“I asked you a question, Angus,” Jules said. The soles on his hot pink sneakers squeaked against the floor as he came to a stop in front of the bound bovid. “Have you been a good bull?”

Angus nodded quickly, looking up at Jules’s smiling face. Any reply he might have tried was silenced by the thick gag shoved into his mouth.

“What was that? Aren’t you going to answer me?” Jules giggled, tilting his head. Angus renewed his struggles against the chains and leather cuffs. “Have you been a bad bull, is that it?”

‘*No, no! I’ve been good! I’ve been good!*’, Angus wanted to scream, but managed only muffled cries against the rubber plugging his mouth.

“You know what happens to bad bulls,” Jules said, running his manicured human fingers down Angus’s back. Beneath a layer of silky, light brown fur, the bull’s taut muscles flexed against the harness restraining them. “If you’ve been bad, I’ll have to punish you, Angus.”

Jules walked around the suspended figure, gently massaging Angus’s muscles as he walked. He possessively squeezed Angus’s thick glutes, earning a loud moan. Producing a small remote control from his tight jeans, he pressed a button and a winch whirred to life above them. Slowly, Angus’s hooves were lowered toward the ground, almost but not quite making contact. Snickering at the helpless bull’s whimpers, Jules kneeled behind Angus’s massive behind.

“Wow, you must be soooo pent up,” Jules whispered, leaning his head forward, his breath playing over Angus’s exposed taint. Just in front of him hung the bull’s thick manhood. “I bet you’re just aching to release. That’s all you can think about, isn’t it?” Angus cried out from behind the gag. Jules’s hot breath washed over his balls. As slowly as he could, Jules laid his tongue against the fat testicles in front of him and dragged upward. Angus shook in pleasure as his too-full nuts were gently caressed by the human’s soft tongue. Jules smacked his lips, savouring the taste and smell of Angus’s huge bull balls.

“Aww, poor bull… Maybe I should let you cum after all?”

Angus howled into the cock-shaped gag as Jules grabbed his marble-hard cock with both hands and stroked it. A river of thick precum poured from Angus’s dick as Jules jerked him off. ‘Yes! Just a little more!’, He thought, every synapse in his brain firing as his heavy, aching balls pulled up toward his body and-

Nothing. Jules released his cock, watching as the veiny organ throbbed, but Angus didn’t get to orgasm.
Angus cried in frustration, his strong chest heaving with every sob as he was once again denied release. If only he’d gotten a second more of that delicious contact.

“Good bulls get to cum, Angus,” Jules said, his voice icy calm. “You haven’t been good yet.” Jules groped the bull’s inner thighs, feeling the contractions as Angus cried. He’d mould him into a proper, model animal yet.

Leaning his head forward, Jules inhaled the heady scent of Angus’s sweat. The room they were in was sweltering, and Angus had been struggling against the chains for a long time. ‘Just a little indulgence,’ Jules thought, leaning forward to run his tongue up over Angus’s taint. Above him lay the bull’s puckered hole. The thick ring of muscle was completely exposed to the air. Jules let his tongue play with the sensitive skin around Angus’s hole. From the centre of the dimpled opening, a slender rubber handle emerged. From within, Jules felt soft, pulsing vibrations.

Jules grabbed the loop of rubber and pulled. Angus groaned as his hole was forced open from within. With a lewd ‘plop’, Jules pulled a small vibrating plug loose. It fell onto the floor, angrily shaking and jumping around. Initially, Angus felt relieved, but that was short-lived.

Moaning himself, Jules attacked Angus’s stretched hole with his mouth. His face was obscured completely by Angus’s enormous glutes as he feasted. Angus bucked his hips as much as the chains allowed, squirming as Jules ate him out.

Angus tasted so manly. The sweat and musk and sheer desperate virility mingled to dominate Jules’s palate. The human brought a slim hand crashing down onto Angus’s ass, the bull’s hole fanning open in response.

Jules licked, gnawed and sucked on the puffy, well-used hole, feeling the muscle pulse and wink in response. Jules had tasted many men, but Angus was his favourite by far. The bull was so much larger than him, it made the experience all the richer. Hearing Angus’s agonised moans spurred Jules on further. He pulled back and spat, admiring the way the gaping donut ring swallowed his saliva.

Knowing the bull had no choice but to hang on for the ride was certainly the chief attraction, however. Jules laughed inwardly as he slobbered over Angus’s hole. He knew that the bull’s neglected cock was throbbing wildly just a few centimetres away. That part wasn’t going to get more attention in a while, though.

Finally considering himself done, Jules stood up, wiping his lips on his shirt sleeve. On the ground, the little vibrating plug seemed to finally be running out of batteries, and only sputtered periodically. Just as good, he was ready to move on anyway.

“I don’t think this little thing was doing the job, do you?” Jules said, kicking the used plug to the side. Angus trembled as the twinky human sauntered over to the wall in front of him, standing in front of a large wooden armoire. “Oh, what’s that?” Jules squatted down in front of Angus’s head, laying a hand against the bull’s cheek. Those large brown eyes looked pleadingly into Jules’s smaller blue. “Are you afraid I’ll find something in there to hurt you with?” Angus whimpered and nodded.

“Oh baby,” Jules said, caressing Angus’s cheek. “I would never hurt my gorgeous bull. This is for your own best. I know how badly you want to be good for me.”

He stood up and backed toward the large wardrobe. Jules giggled as he swung the doors open, revealing an inside stacked with an assortment of toys and instruments. One section was devoted to different flogs and whips, the next to a collection of chastity belts. He’d had to order custom; Angus was too generously proportioned to fit into anything off the shelf.

All those could wait, however. Jules wasn’t currently in the business of causing pain, he had other goals. Opening a drawer, Jules revealed a set of five brightly coloured plugs. From his position in the room, Angus saw the pastel-coloured plastic and knew what it meant.

“Do we start with the smallest one?” Jules said, holding up one of the plugs to the light. The ‘smallest one’ would have torn Jules in two without serious preparation, but Angus was big enough to take it easily. “No, I don’t think so.”

Jules picked the middle one, a mean-looking hunk of blue silicone. He flicked a switch on the bottom of the handle, and the massive bulb came alive. His entire arm shook as the plastic undulated. Angus watched in horror as Jules held the toy toward him.

Jules picked up a bottle of lube from the wardrobe and closed it behind him. He walked around Angus, the bull completely still in trepidation.

“This is going to feel so good for you,” Jules said as he coated the toy in the slick lube. “You loved the little one so much, just think of how this will feel.” He spread Angus’s ass cheeks, seeing the thick hole throb in anticipation. He leaned forward and planted a quick kiss on the pulsing opening. “Relax for me, now. Can you do that?”

Angus groaned as Jules pushed the thick plug into him. For a split-second, he felt relief as the thickest part passed into him and his hole closed around the handle, but immediately the plastic pressed against his prostate. He was so, so full. Jules grinned as he pushed on the plug, watching Angus’s legs flex. He didn’t have any toes, but if he did, he would curl them.

“Such a good bull,” Jules whispered, fondling the bull’s big ass. “You’re a beauty, Angus. All this beef, just for little me. You’re such a good bull.”

Angus breathed deep, adjusting to the thick plug.

“But not. Good. Enough!”

Jules laughed as he turned on the plug. Instantly, the motor inside made the plug shake and vibrate against Angus’s prostate. His cock and nuts throbbed painfully, stimulated to the brink of orgasm, but not quite all the way.

Jules walked around to Angus’s front, watching as the bull’s mighty body convulsed from the sensory assault. He stood with his legs spread wide, arms folded across his chest. He wasn’t a very imposing figure, but Angus knew better than to underestimate him.

Jules reached around the back of Angus’s head and undid the straps to the gag. The plastic cock fell out of the bull’s mouth and onto the floor, saliva dripping from Angus’s slack jaws.

“Please, Jules,” Angus looked up, eyes watering as waves of pleasure tore through him. “Please, I need to-“
Jules slapped Angus’s cheek; his eyes stern.

“Good bulls don’t talk.” Angus whimpered, watching as Jules undid the fly on his jeans. He’d gone commando, and immediately his shaved smooth manhood flopped out. “Good bulls use their mouth to suck dick.”

Jules held onto Angus’s horns as he drove his cock into the bull’s muzzle. Angus hungrily sucked him, his thick tongue coiling around Jules’s slim dick. Meanwhile, the plug inside him continued its ceaseless assault.
Jules thrust fully into Angus, quickly spilling his seed into the bull’s throat. Angus swallowed it all, laving his tongue across the human’s crotch.

“See? If you behave, that’s what you’ll get to do,” Jules said, breathing heavily as he stuffed his softening dick back in his jeans. “I always reward bulls that are good to me.”

“And you’re sure that you’re comfortable taking it even further?” Jules asked, lifting the coffee cup to his lips. “It’s going to get intense.”

“I like it when you’re in control,” Angus said, leaning across the table to hold Jules’s hand. The human’s smaller fingers disappeared completely against his own. “I trust you.”

“That means a lot to me,” Jules said, smiling at Angus.

“Just one thing,” Angus said, leaning back in his chair.

“Name it, love. You’re the one making the rules.”

“Can you do it while wearing your…” Angus hesitated, grinning as he tried to find the words. “You know the outfit you wore to the Halloween party we went to? That tight pastel candy affair?”

“The slutty femboy costume?” Jules said, throwing his head back in laughter. Jules couldn’t see it on his face, but he could tell Angus was blushing from the way his furry ears swished lightly. “Sure thing. I’ll wear whatever you want if it gets you into it.”

The next week, Jules pulled on the tight jeans and pink shirt and walked down to the basement. Angus always wanted some time to himself before they got going. It was his time to relax and get himself in the right headspace.

Jules met him at the foot of the basement stairs and they walked together into their play room. Jules never wanted to call it a dungeon, he thought it sounded too medieval.

“You ready, sweetheart?” Jules asked, slowly combing Angus’s mane with his hands.

“Yeah, I’m excited,” Angus said, giddy as Jules strapped him into the harness.

A while later, Angus was snugly secured into the harness and the electrical winches above them lifted him off the floor. Jules walked around him, inspecting the padded harness and cuffs to make sure they wouldn’t chafe or break.

“And you remember what to do if you want to stop?” Jules asked, squatting in front of Angus’s face.

“Of course,” Angus replied. He snapped his fingers on both his hands, their signal to stop.

“I love you,” Jules said, leaning forward to kiss Angus on the forehead. “Now open up for me.” He brandished a thick, penis-shaped gag. It fit perfectly in Angus’s mouth, and he secured it behind the bull’s head.

Jules took a deep breath. His eyes narrowed as he locked gazes with Angus.

“Are you going to be a good bull for me?”


## Break


Angus had graduated to the thickest plug. Jules delighted in the low buzzing that filled the room as the obscene toy pulverised Angus’s sensitive prostate. Jules had laid down beneath Angus, his face level with the bull’s chest.

Reaching up with both hands, he grabbed Angus’s nipples, softly rolling the fleshy nubs around his fingers. Angus involuntarily flexed his massive pectorals, making Jules pull hard on his nipples. He moaned out in pain and pleasure, making Jules renew his attack.

“Those are the wrong noises,” Jules said, sitting up to have his face next to Angus’s. “What noises do a happy, good bull make?” He tweaked Angus’s nipples, prompting a response.

“Aah.. Mooo?” Angus cried out. Jules clapped his hands together in joy, his eyes gazing warmly at the bull. “Moooo, moooo…”

“You’re doing so well, Angus,” Jules said, looking into his lover’s eyes. Angus’s cock throbbed and dumped another thick glob of precum onto the floor. “Do you want to cum? Have you been good enough for that?”

“Moooo! Moooo!” Angus’s ears burned in shame as he mooed out. He was a good bull. He was going to get to cum!
“Just keep that up,” Jules said, scooting back under Angus to come face-to-face with his neglected manhood. It looked angry. A massive spire of meat that pulsed endlessly. Jules marvelled at the power it contained, and how helpless it was to use any of it.

He cupped a hand under the wildly throbbing bull dick, catching a fat puddle of pre. He brought it to his lips, drinking the sweet liquid down. Angus kept mooing, sensing that he was soon to be rewarded.
Jules ran a lone finger down Angus’s manhood, teasing the enormous length. His hand continued upward, hefting the heavy balls in his palm. They were so big he couldn’t fit them in one hand. The skin was sopping wet with sweat, leaving thick drops behind when he let go. Jules licked it up, letting the masculine taste fill his mouth.

“I think it’s time to give you your reward, Angus,” Jules said. His hand ran up to grasp the handle on the massive plug, still happily buzzing away inside the bull’s hole. Finding the switch, Jules activated the second vibrator setting. Angus didn’t realise it was possible, but the plug pulsed even stronger inside him. He mooed again and again as Jules pressed the plug handle against his hole.

“That’s right, moo for me!” Jules said, grabbing Angus’s cock in both hands. “You’re a good bull, and good bulls get to cum!”

Angus’s vision blurred as Jules planted his mouth against his engorged cockhead and sucked. Those nimble little hands ran up and down his length, deliciously stimulating him. Finally, the dam broke. His balls drew painfully tight against his crotch and he finally got to release.

Jules had to swallow immediately as the massive wave of bull seed hit his mouth. Thick and gloopy, it rapidly filled his stomach with its warmth. What felt like a bucket of thick cum poured into him as Angus’s cock jumped and throbbed. The bull’s body trembled, hips bucking against the restraint to deliver his load into Jules’s welcoming mouth.

“Mooo! Mooo!” Angus’s mind felt short-circuited. Jules had held him on the edge for so long, and he finally got the release he craved.

‘*I’m a good bull. I’m a good bull!*’

## Break

Angus whimpered as Jules pulled the plug out of his sore hole. The electric winches whined as his massive body was lowered onto the floor. Jules had put down a towel so Angus wouldn’t land on the bare tile.

“There we go,” Jules said as he unlocked the cuffs and harness restraining the bull. He sat on his knees next to Angus, pulling the bull’s softly furred face into his lap. “You did so well, love. So well…” He brushed Angus’s hair, letting the massive bull’s breathing slowly stabilise. “You okay to move?”

Angus nodded, rising first to his knees and then onto his hooves. Jules helped him up to the extent he could. Angus was too big for him to really be of much use. Jules guided Angus out of the basement and into their master bathroom. The bull shivered slightly from the colder air.

“Come on, let’s get you warm,” Jules said, turning on the hot water to fill their bathtub. Angus groaned as he sat down in the slowly rising water. Every muscle in his body ached from exertion. Jules sat down on the edge next to him. Angus took a deep breath and relaxed as Jules scratched the sides of his face and ears.

“How are you feeling?” Jules asked, squirting a sizable glob of fragrant fur shampoo into the bath.

“Exhausted,” Angus said, his voice hoarse. He laid his head against the bathtub edge, letting Jules rub his face. “Exhausted, but good.”

“I’m glad,” Jules said, leaning in to plant a kiss between his eyes. “I’ll be right back.”

Shortly, Jules joined him in the bath. He’d brought a cold soda and the bull gladly drank down the sugary beverage. Angus laid still in the warm water as Jules slowly massaged his weary body, working the lavender shampoo into his shiny fur. He’d been a good bull, and good bulls were rewarded.
