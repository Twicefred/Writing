Maximilian Morganstein closed the front door behind him. Home at last. The entry hall was dark, save for a sliver of moonlight shining through the stained glass windows. It was enough for Maximilian's keen feline eyes, and he strode quietly through to the great hall just adjacent.

Leaving his luggage on the dark green carpet, Maximilian yawned and stretched. He was tired from his journey, but not sleepy.</br>
'*Florian will be most upset I had to let myself in,*' The lion thought, unbuttoning his coat and throwing it onto the luggage. Florian, his butler, would take care of it in the morning.

It was late, closer to morning than evening, but Maximilian had travelled far and hadn't quite turned the clock back fully. He'd need to get some sleep eventually, but for now he could settle in with a drink and a good book.</br>
Opening the door to the dining room, he felt his way along the wall to where he knew a few bottles of liquor would be. The dining room was darker, the moon didn't quite shine through the tall windows.</br>
Maximilian picked up a glass from the small wet bar he had set up, but there wasn't at all enough light to pour a drink. Leading the way with one paw stretched out, he looked for the light switch.

Maximilian switched the light on and turned around. Immediately the room was bathed in warm light from two of the three great crystal chandeliers. The lion's breath caught in his throat as his eyes adjusted to the light. In shock, the glass he'd been holding slipped from his paw and shattered against the dark hardwood floor.</br>

"And that's when I discovered him," Maximilian said, sinking back into the velvet armchair. He clutched a glass of whiskey in one paw, fortification for his nerves.

"Thank you, Mr. Morganstein." Detective Robert Rizzolini closed his notebook and stood up. "I'll have a few more questions for you, but I'd like to spend some time inspecting the crime scene. Where will I be able to find you?"

"I have no pressing engagements," Maximilian said, taking a hefty sip from his drink. "I'll be here or in my office upstairs if you need me."

Robert nodded and left Maximilian to his drink. He walked briskly out of the grand library where Maximilian had given his account of last night. He heard the sound of a camera and several sets of feet in the next room over.

"Have you found anything?" Robert asked as he entered the dining room.

"Nothing we didn't see the first time," A policeman answered, stepping back as Robert approached the crime scene.

The dining room centred on a large mahogany table. Splotches of congealed blood covered the polished surface. The table had cracked in the middle where the middle of three grand chandeliers had crashed into it from above. Below the destroyed mass of delicate crystal and shining metal lay a dead raccoon.

"One hell of a way to go," Robert said to himself as he leaned in to look closer. He opened his notebook to go over the details he'd been given. "Levi Lawson, 32 years old," He recited quietly.

The late Levi had been Maximilian's estate manager, intimately involved in running the large aristocratic household and the adjoining business interests.
