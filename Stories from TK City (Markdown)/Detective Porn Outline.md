## Characters

**Detective** - Switch</br>
Species: Human</br>
Name: Rob "Raunchy" Rizzolini


**Estate Agent** - Murder victim</br>
Species: Raccoon</br>
Name: Levi Lawson</br>
Levi was Maximilian's manager and estate agent. He got into this position by virtue of his father's relationship to Max. While he does modernise and skilfully manage the estate, he has been embezzling funds for his own personal gain.


**Aristocrat**</br>
Species: Lion</br>
Name: Marquis Maximilian Morganstein
The Aristocrat is the only main character (other than the murder victim) who doesn't figure in a sex scene.</br>


**Fitness Instructor** - Top</br>
Species: Bull</br>
Name: Sebastian Souder</br>
Sebastian is a recent hire, having arrived at the estate only three month's past. This makes it relatively unlikely that he'd be the murderer, however he is hot-headed and several other staff members report having witnessed him and the victim argue.</br>
Sebastian isn't the first PT employed at the mansion. His predecessor left when he realised that Maximilian had no intention of following his advice.</br>
Sebastian has no direct motive for murder, but is initially questioned because of his temper and history of fighting with the other staff.


**Head Cook** - Top</br>
Species: Bear</br>
Name: Claude Champignon</br>
Claude isn't actually French. He adopted a new name and accent to bluff his way into culinary school. He lives in fear that this will be revealed, and will go to considerable lengths to protect his false identity.


**Gardener** - Bottom - Murderer</br>
Species: Fennec Fox (?)</br>
Name: Gabriel Greene</br>
Gabriel is the murderer. He is secretly romantically involved with Maximilian. Their relationship is kept a secret because their respective families disapprove.


**Butler** - Top</br>
Species: Friesian Horse</br>
Name: Florian Fortier</br>
Florian has been in the aristocrat's employ the longest. He was on good terms with the victim, but some modernisations at the estate have put his job in peril. Murdering the estate agent may put those plans on ice, securing his position and influence.


## Plot Outline

Gardener murders Estate Agent in order to protect Aristocrat, who is being swindled. Gardener and Aristocrat are romantically involved in secret.

The gardener commits the murder by first knocking the victim unconscious with a shovel, then dropping a chandelier onto the victim.

The gardener is initially not a suspect because of his small stature, but when Robert discovers that Levi had attempted to blackmail him he meets closer scrutiny.

Gabriel suspected that Levi was mismanaging the estate's money because he was involved in purchasing supplies and the numbers didn't add up. When he confronted Levi, the estate agent retaliated by blackmailing him.

To protect Maximilian, Gabriel murders Levi.
