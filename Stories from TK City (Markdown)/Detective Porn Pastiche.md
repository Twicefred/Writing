# Private Eye Porn Pastiche

**When a dead body is discovered in the dining room of a vast country mansion, detective Robert "Raunchy" Rizzolini is called to the scene to investigate. Using his second-to-none powers of deduction, he cracks the case.**

**When I started writing this, it was a serious detective story with light romance undertones. I quickly derailed it into erotic pastiche.**

"I need you to find out who did it."

"Don't worry Mr. Morganstein, you hired the best."

Robert Rizzolini's trained eyes surveyed the room. A gruesome scene, truly, but he'd seen worse in his days.

"Tell me, when exactly did you discover what had happened?"

Maximilian Morganstein took off his eyeglasses to polish them with a handkerchief. Robert watched as the lion rubbed the cloth across the glass. He seemed to be creating more smudges than he wiped off.

"Late yesterday night," Maximilian began, putting the glasses back on. "I'd just returned from visiting my brother. I was scheduled to arrive home today, but I returned early and had to let myself in." Robert stood still as Maximilian paced the room. The sun shone in through the tall windows, glittering in the glass display cases lining the opposite wall. "Normally, Fernando would be there to greet me, but I hadn't informed him of the change in time. He was most upset that I'd had to fend for myself."

Fernando, the butler, had greeted Robert when he had arrived an hour past. The tall Friesian horse had been reluctant to let Robert examine the dining room without supervision, but even a devoted servant had to bow to police protocol.

"I didn't feel very tired, so I resolved to catch up on some reading. I went to get myself a drink..." Maximilian's voice petered out. He pointed to the dining room table. "And that's when I saw it."
