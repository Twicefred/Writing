# Private Eye Porn Pastiche

**When a dead body is discovered in the dining room of a vast country mansion, detective Robert "Raunchy" Rizzolini is called to the scene to investigate. Using his second-to-none powers of deduction, he cracks the case.**

**When I started writing this, it was a serious detective story with light romantic undertones. I quickly derailed it into erotic pastiche.**



Robert Rizzolini's trained eyes surveyed the room. A gruesome scene, truly, but he'd seen worse in his days.

"Tell me, when exactly did you discover what had happened?"

Maximilian Morganstein took off his eyeglasses to polish them with a handkerchief. Robert watched as the lion rubbed the cloth across the glass. He seemed to be creating more smudges than he wiped off.

"Late yesterday night," Maximilian began, putting the glasses back on. "I'd just returned from visiting my brother. I was scheduled to arrive home today, but I returned early and had to let myself in." Robert stood still as Maximilian paced the room. The sun shone in through the tall windows, glittering in the glass display cases lining the opposite wall. "Normally, Florian would be there to greet me, but I hadn't informed him of the change in time. He was most upset that I'd had to fend for myself."

Florian, the butler, had greeted Robert when he had arrived an hour earlier. The tall Friesian horse had been reluctant to let Robert examine the dining room unsupervised, but even a devoted servant had to bow to police protocol.

"I didn't feel very tired, so I resolved to catch up on some reading. I went to get myself a drink..." Maximilian's voice petered out. He pointed to the dining room table. "And that's when I saw it."

The polished mahogany table was covered in congealed blood. It had cracked in the middle where a massive chandelier had crashed into it from above. The delicate crystals and shining metal barely covered the dead body beneath it. It was safe to assume that this wasn't a natural death.

"I understand the deceased had been in your employ for quite some time?"

"Indeed he had," Maximilian said. He turned away from the dead body with a frown. "I'm sorry, detective, but can we perhaps continue our conversation elsewhere?"

Robert nodded his agreement and Maximilian led them out of the dining room into the adjacent library. Robert's shoes creaked against the hardwood floor, but despite his considerable size, Maximilian's naked paws were completely silent. 

"I hired Levi five years ago," Maximilian said, motioning for Robert to sit down in a green velvet sofa. "His father had worked for me earlier, so he was a perfect candidate for the job. Estates like these are a rare sight these days, and we have to be clever to survive. Levi does-" Maximilian stopped himself, the sofa creaking as he sank into the cushions. "Levi *did* a lot to modernise and save this estate from ruin. I wouldn't be sitting here today if it weren't for him."

"It sounds like you were close. I'm sorry for your loss Mr. Morganstein," Robert said. The lion nodded back. He kept a stiff upper lip, but Robert could tell that Levi Lawson's death weighed heavily on his mind. Then again, finding a dead body on your dinner table would throw anyone for a loop.

"Can you think of anyone who Levi didn't get along with? Any recent events which made you concerned for him?"

"To my knowledge, Levi got along well with everyone. He was a quiet type, but I never knew him to make any enemies."

Robert's gaze wandered around the room as Maximilian described what he knew of Levi's relationships. Not much in the way of family, except a sister in the nearby village. A few friends, but none lived close by.

Levi's body was discovered in the dining room. While an autopsy hadn't been performed, Robert assumed the cause of death to be blunt force trauma from the overhead chandelier falling onto him. '*That would mean the killer is likely someone in the mansion household,*' Robert thought. At the very least, someone on the inside was a co-conspirator. He'd need a list of staff members to speak to, but where to begin?

"The only thing I can think of, is a fight Levi got into with Sebastian a month ago," Maximilian said, leaning forward in the sofa. A fight. That was a start.

"What was it about?"

"I can't remember, I don't think it was very serious. Sebastian is a tad hot-headed, so it doesn't surprise me. I only learned of it second hand when Fernando mentioned it to me."

"And who is Sebastian?" Robert asked, pulling a weathered notebook from his coat pocket.

"He's my personal trainer and dietician," Maximilian said. "I take my health seriously, and Sebastian is the very best in the business."

Robert looked at the lion sitting in front of him. '*There is no way this guy follows advice from a PT,*' He thought. Maximilian did not look like a man who spent any significant time in a gym. The way in which he filled out his tweed jacket testified to a love of good food and good living. Robert didn't mind the lion's looks, he was quite a striking figure, but why tell such an obvious lie?

"Where might I find him?"

"The gym is downstairs, I'm happy to take you there," Maximilian said, standing up and beckoning Robert to follow.

"You have a personal trainer and a private gym in the basement?" Robert asked. He couldn't entirely hide his surprise, it seemed lavish even for someone of Maximilian's wealth.

"It's available for the staff to use as well, most find it to be a nice benefit," The lion said as they walked together. He led Robert through a series of rooms and corridors, each more opulently furnished than the next.

While they walked, Robert attempted a mental map of the vast estate. The building centred around a grand entry hall, with two wings on either side. On one side lay the dining room, library and drawing room. On the other side were rooms displaying the family Morganstein's vast collection of artworks.</br>
Each wing of the building connected to the basement via several smaller stairways, all hidden away behind colonnades and inconspicuous doors.</br>
The second floor, in turn, was only accessible via a central grand staircase and one passageway for servants. It housed bedrooms and guest rooms, as well as Maximilian's offices.

The gym was the most austere room in the mansion, filled only with weights and workout machines. The far wall was covered in mirrors, making the room appear much larger than it really was.
