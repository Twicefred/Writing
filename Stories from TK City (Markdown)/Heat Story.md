"Starting already, huh?" You say, putting your phone down on the coffee table beside you.

"Think so," Byron replies, closing the door behind him. You watch as he unloads three massive grocery bags on the hallway floor and drops his coat on top of them. The floor rumbles under his hooves as he walks toward you. With trained arms, he scoops you up from your position on the sofa before crashing down again with you. It's a wonder you haven't broken more furniture yet.

"You holding up okay?" You ask. He's breathing heavily, his entire body tensed like a coiled spring. If you didn't know better, you'd think he was sick with something.

"Same as it always is," He says, pressing his nose against your hair. "Better now, though." You feel him relax somewhat as you run your hands around his strong neck.

"Nothing you haven't handled before," You say, meeting his gaze. You've always thought Byron has the most amazing eyes, like wells of deep, warm green staring back at you.

"That doesn't change how weird it feels," Byron says. He's not quite there yet, but you can tell that it's close. There's a strain in his soft voice, like he wants to speak louder but holds himself back. "It's like I'm not really myself, that doesn't stop feeling strange." You lay silent for a while, trying to think of something to say to comfort him. "It's not bad, just strange. It's better than the alternative."

"That's a low bar to meet, really," You say. He's pressing his damp nose against your neck, breathing you in. He sighs as you comb your fingers through his creamy blonde fur. "Anything is worth having you off that poison."

You'd met Byron years ago, and you hit it off immediately. The handsome bull had swept you off your feet and you were more than happy to let him. Then, he'd changed.

By genetic lottery, Byron went into heat every three months. He'd explained the process to you, and mentioned that he was taking some kind of medication to supress it. You hadn't dwelled on it, after all it was an uncommon enough occurrence that you didn't know too much about it. But when you saw the effects of the pills he was taking, you realised you needed to examine the issue further.

When it started, he became a shadow of his former self. He barely spoke, and when he did it was clear he didn't have any happy thoughts to share. The saving grace was that he seemed so out of it himself that he barely realised what was happening, but seeing him so brought down was a shock.

So you persuaded him to stop. After all, he didn't have to deal with what he was going through alone. The next time around, he was a changed man. Usually, Byron was a gentle, apprehensive person. He made you open important letters when he got too nervous to read them, jumped at loud noises and hugged you at night like he was terrified you were going to slip through his fingers. Not that you minded any of that. Being trusted is rewarding in itself.

When the heat took hold, it all faded. He became brash, full of confidence bordering on arrogance. He saw what he wanted and now he was going to reach out and take it.

"My boss was being weird about it, too," Byron says, pulling you back to the present. "She kept looking at me and standing close."

"That's what we call harassment, Byron," You say, brushing his shaggy fringe out of his eyes. "You should tell HR about it if she makes you uncomfortable."

"Nah, I told her to sit her little ass down," Byron says and laughs. Then, he stops himself and smiles at you. "That's not really like me, is it?"

"I'd like to think you're a man of many sides," You say, relaxing in his arms as he nuzzles the side of your face. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see the tip of his horns puncturing the sofa cushions. Again.
