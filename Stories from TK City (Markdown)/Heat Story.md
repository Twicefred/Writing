"Starting already, huh?" David said, putting his phone down on the coffee table.

"Think so," Byron muttered and closed the front door behind him. He'd brought home three large grocery bags with supplies for the coming week. David looked on as he put them down on the hall floor.

The floor creaked under Byron's hooves as he lumbered over to the living room. David scooted over on the sofa to give him room but Byron picked him up in his arms instead.

"Hey there," David said as Byron laid down on the sofa. Byron didn't answer, silently holding David tight in his arms. "You holding up okay?"

"Starting already, huh?" You say, putting your phone down on the coffee table beside you.

"Think so," Byron replies, closing the door behind him. You watch as he unloads three massive grocery bags on the hallway floor and drops his coat on top of them. The floor rumbles under his hooves as he walks toward you. With trained arms, he scoops you up from your position on the sofa before crashing down again with you. It's a wonder you haven't broken more furniture yet.

"You holding up okay?" You ask. He's breathing heavily, his entire body tensed like a coiled spring. If you didn't know better, you'd think he was sick with something.

"Same as it always is," He says, pressing his nose against your hair. "Better now, though." You feel him relax somewhat as you run your hands around his strong neck.

"Nothing you haven't handled before," You say, meeting his gaze. You've always thought Byron has the most amazing eyes, like wells of deep, warm green staring back at you.

"That doesn't change how weird it feels," Byron says. He's not quite there yet, but you can tell that it's close. There's a strain in his soft voice, like he wants to speak louder but holds himself back. "It's like I'm not really myself, that doesn't get easier to handle." You lay silent for a while, trying to think of something to say to comfort him. "At least it's better than the alternative."
