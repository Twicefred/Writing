"Starting already, huh?" You say, putting your phone down on the coffee table beside you.

"Think so," Byron replies, closing the door behind him. You watch as he unloads three massive grocery bags on the hallway floor and drops his coat on top of them. The floor rumbles under his hooves as he walks toward you. With trained arms, he scoops you up from your position on the sofa before crashing down again with you. It's a wonder you haven't broken more furniture yet.

"You holding up okay?" You ask. He's breathing heavily, his entire body tensed like a coiled spring. If you didn't know better, you'd think he was sick with something.

"Same as it always is," He says, pressing his nose against your hair. "Better now, though." You feel him relax somewhat as you run your hands around his strong neck.

"Nothing you haven't handled before," You say, meeting his gaze. You've always thought Byron has the most amazing eyes, like wells of deep, warm green staring back at you.

"That doesn't change how weird it feels," Byron says. He's not quite there yet, but you can tell that it's close. There's a strain in his soft voice, like he wants to speak louder but holds himself back. "It's like I'm not really myself, that doesn't stop feeling strange." You lay silent for a while, trying to think of something to say to comfort him. "It's not bad, just strange. It's better than the alternative."

"That's a low bar to meet, really," You say. He's pressing his damp nose against your neck, breathing you in. He sighs as you comb your fingers through his creamy blonde fur. "Anything is worth having you off that poison."

You'd met Byron years ago, and you hit it off immediately. The handsome bull had swept you off your feet and you were more than happy to let him. Then, he'd changed.

By genetic lottery, Byron went into heat every three months. He'd explained the process to you, and mentioned that he was taking some kind of medication to supress it. You hadn't dwelled on it, after all it was an uncommon enough occurrence that you didn't know too much about it. But when you saw the effects of the pills he was taking, you realised you needed to examine the issue further.

When it started, he became a shadow of his former self. He barely spoke, and when he did it was clear he didn't have any happy thoughts to share. The saving grace was that he seemed so out of it himself that he barely realised what was happening, but seeing him so brought down was a shock.

So you persuaded him to stop. After all, he didn't have to deal with what he was going through alone. The next time around, he was a changed man. Usually, Byron was a gentle, apprehensive person. He made you open important letters when he got too nervous to read them, jumped at loud noises and hugged you at night like he was terrified you were going to slip through his fingers. Not that you minded any of that. Being trusted is rewarding in itself.

When the heat took hold, it all faded. He became brash, full of confidence bordering on arrogance. He saw what he wanted and now he was going to reach out and take it.

"My boss was being weird about it, too," Byron says, pulling you back to the present. "She kept looking at me and standing close."

"That's what we call harassment, Byron," You say, brushing his shaggy fringe out of his eyes. "You should tell HR about it if she makes you uncomfortable."

"Nah, I told her to sit her little ass down," Byron says and laughs. Then, he stops himself and smiles at you. "That's not really like me, is it?"

"I'd like to think you're a man of many sides," You say, relaxing in his arms as he nuzzles the side of your face. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see the tip of his horns puncturing the sofa cushions. Again.

You don't move much for the rest of the afternoon and evening. You can feel the fire building within Byron. He gets quiet and possessive, holding you tight as if to prove that he can. When you test his strength, he grunts and flexes his arms around you. You won't go anywhere until the bull allows you to.

You feel a bit guilty for the way in which you're enjoying his changes, he's told you before that it's a confusing experience. Regular, gentle Byron is perfect the way he is; but the hormone-fuelled, hyper-masculine Byron is a different experience entirely. You think of it as an experience because you have no choice but to let him be in control of everything.

Like when he lifts you off the sofa and carries you off to bed. You don't get to object or set terms here, Byron is making your decisions for you.

He's slow with you, for now. Even as the flames burn ever brighter inside him, Byron knows that you need time to adjust. He strips you naked, wordlessly regarding your smaller, smooth body laid prone on the bed. What a foolish creature you are, to lay yourself bare before the predator like this.

Then he's on top of you, his fur bristles against your skin as he presses his muzzle against your mouth. He doesn't close his eyes as he makes out with you, keeping you fixed in his gaze. Your arms are passively around his thick neck whilst his big hands grope your body. His breath is like a rockslide when his hands reach the small of your back. You can see the lust in his eyes as he considers how to best violate you. You're so small to him, a little plaything that eagerly waits to be used.

His big tongue fills your mouth completely, snaking down to your throat. You feel him reach for something on the nightstand, but you can't look away from him. You hear a bottle open, and moments later you feel a cold, slick sensation against your ass.

Byron grunts in satisfaction as your eyes go wide. Your hole yields to one of his fingers and he pushes it in with ease. You try to gasp but his tongue fills your mouth and throat completely. You can tell that Byron revels in your helplessness, as do you.

He stretches you slowly, making sure you feel every bit of his fingers invade you. All the while he pushes you back against the bed with his other hand. You moan as your body opens for him. The air is thick with his scent, you'll be thoroughly marinated in it over the next few days.

You wonder if your colleagues know why you take a week off every three months. Maybe some of them can smell Byron on you when you get back. They'll know instantly that you've surrendered to the inferno, that you're crying in pleasure while your stronger partner takes what he wants from you. Is that why Gerard, the white German shepherd, always looks weird at you? Does he know what a whore you are? You don't give a fuck. If Byron needs you to be a whore, you'll spread those legs as wide as they can go.

"Ready?" Byron grunts. It's the first word he's uttered in hours. You see him stroke his cock, aiming it straight at your slackened hole. You nod and your body quakes with anticipation of being filled with that magnificent bull cock.

It always hurts at first. You wince as Byron pushes inside you. His jaw is clenched tight, barely keeping himself from slamming in as hard as he can. You whimper and throw your head back as he hilts his cock inside you. His balls lay heavy against your ass, preparing to fill you to bursting. You can't wait to feel that.

"Oh fuck..." You moan as Byron drags his dick all the way out and pushes it inside you again. He leers down at you. The gentle giant is all but gone, the fire is in charge now. He lowers his body onto yours, pinning you to the mattress beneath his bulky frame. Your face is mashed against his chest, the light fur matted with sweat.
