*When your boyfriend goes into heat, it's your job to sate his urges.*

*The release of WoW Shadowlands has occupied much of my free time, but after staring at my Tauren for a few hours straight, I knew I needed to take some time to write out exactly what I would let him do to me.*

*Comments, feedback and faves are much appreciated!*

"Starting already, huh?" You say, putting your phone down on the coffee table beside you.

"Think so," Byron replies, closing the door behind him. You watch as he unloads three massive grocery bags on the hallway floor and drops his coat on top of them. The floor rumbles under his hooves as he walks toward you. With trained arms, he scoops you up from your position on the sofa before crashing down again with you. It's a wonder you haven't broken more furniture yet.

"You holding up okay?" You ask. He's breathing heavily, his entire body tensed like a coiled spring. If you didn't know better, you'd think he was sick with something.

"Same as it always is," He says, pressing his nose against your hair. "Better now, though." You feel him relax somewhat as you run your hands around his strong neck.

"Nothing you haven't handled before," You say, meeting his gaze. You've always thought Byron has the most amazing eyes, like wells of deep, warm green staring back at you.

"That doesn't change how weird it feels," Byron says. He's not quite there yet, but you can tell that it's close. There's a strain in his soft voice, like he wants to speak louder but holds himself back. "It's like I'm not really myself, that doesn't stop feeling strange." You lay silent for a while, trying to think of something to say to comfort him. "It's not bad, just strange. It's better than the alternative."

"That's a low bar to meet, really," You say. He's pressing his damp nose against your neck, breathing you in. He sighs as you comb your fingers through his creamy blonde fur. "Anything is worth having you off that poison."

You'd met Byron years ago, and you hit it off immediately. The handsome bull had swept you off your feet and you were more than happy to let him. Then, he'd changed.

By genetic lottery, Byron went into heat every three months. He'd explained the process to you, and mentioned that he was taking some kind of medication to supress it. You hadn't dwelled on it, after all it was an uncommon enough occurrence that you didn't know too much about it. But when you saw the effects of the pills he was taking, you realised you needed to examine the issue further.

When it started, he became a shadow of his former self. He barely spoke, and when he did it was clear he didn't have any happy thoughts to share. The saving grace was that he seemed so out of it himself that he barely realised what was happening, but seeing him so brought down was a shock.

So you persuaded him to stop. After all, he didn't have to deal with what he was going through alone. The next time around, he was a changed man. Usually, Byron was a gentle, apprehensive person. He made you open important letters when he got too nervous to read them, jumped at loud noises and hugged you at night like he was terrified you were going to slip through his fingers. Not that you minded any of that. Being trusted is rewarding in itself.

When the heat took hold, it all faded. He became brash, full of confidence bordering on arrogance. He saw what he wanted and now he was going to reach out and take it.

"My boss was being weird about it, too," Byron says, pulling you back to the present. "She kept looking at me and standing close."

"That's what we call harassment, Byron," You say, brushing his shaggy fringe out of his eyes. "You should tell HR about it if she makes you uncomfortable."

"Nah, I told her to sit her little ass down," Byron says and laughs. Then, he stops himself and smiles at you. "That's not really like me, is it?"

"I'd like to think you're a man of many sides," You say, relaxing in his arms as he nuzzles the side of your face. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see the tip of his horns puncturing the sofa cushions. Again.

You don't move much for the rest of the afternoon and evening. You can feel the fire building within Byron. He gets quiet and possessive, holding you tight as if to prove that he can. When you test his strength, he grunts and flexes his arms around you. You won't go anywhere until the bull allows you to.

You feel a bit guilty for the way in which you're enjoying his changes, he's told you before that it's a confusing experience. Regular, gentle Byron is perfect the way he is; but the hormone-fuelled, hyper-masculine Byron is a different experience entirely. You think of it as an experience because you have no choice but to let him be in control of everything.

Like when he lifts you off the sofa and carries you off to bed. You don't get to object or set terms here, Byron is making your decisions for you.

He's slow with you, for now. Even as the flames burn ever brighter inside him, Byron knows that you need time to adjust. He strips you naked, wordlessly regarding your smaller, smooth body laid prone on the bed. What a foolish creature you are, to lay yourself bare before the predator like this.

Then he's on top of you, his fur bristles against your skin as he presses his muzzle against your mouth. He doesn't close his eyes as he makes out with you, keeping you fixed in his gaze. Your arms are passively around his thick neck whilst his big hands grope your body. His breath is like a rockslide when his hands reach the small of your back. You can see the lust in his eyes as he considers how to best violate you. You're so small to him, a little plaything that eagerly waits to be used.

His big tongue fills your mouth completely, snaking down to your throat. You feel him reach for something on the nightstand, but you can't look away from him. You hear a bottle open, and moments later you feel a cold, slick sensation against your ass.

Byron grunts in satisfaction as your eyes go wide. Your hole yields to one of his fingers and he pushes it in with ease. You try to gasp but his tongue fills your mouth and throat completely. You can tell that Byron revels in your helplessness, as do you.

He stretches you slowly, making sure you feel every bit of his fingers invade you. All the while he pushes you back against the bed with his other hand. You moan as your body opens for him. The air is thick with his scent, you'll be thoroughly marinated in it over the next few days.

You wonder if your colleagues know why you take a week off every three months. Maybe some of them can smell Byron on you when you get back. They'll know instantly that you've surrendered to the inferno, that you're crying in pleasure while your stronger partner takes what he wants from you. Is that why Gerard, the white German shepherd, always looks weird at you? Does he know what a whore you are? You don't give a fuck. If Byron needs you to be a whore, you'll spread those legs as wide as they can go.

"Ready?" Byron grunts. It's the first word he's uttered in hours. You see him stroke his cock, aiming it straight at your slackened hole. You nod and your body quakes with anticipation of being filled with that magnificent bull cock.

It always hurts at first. You wince as Byron pushes inside you. His jaw is clenched tight, barely keeping himself from slamming in as hard as he can. You whimper and throw your head back as he hilts his cock inside you. His balls lay heavy against your ass, preparing to fill you to bursting. You can't wait to feel that.

"Oh fuck..." You moan as Byron drags his dick all the way out and pushes it inside you again. He leers down at you. The gentle giant is all but gone, the fire is in charge now. He lowers his body onto yours, pinning you to the mattress beneath his bulky frame. Your face is mashed against his chest, the light fur matted with sweat.

You tighten your arms around as much of Byron as you can grasp when he begins to rut into you. His body stays on top of you, he's using only his powerful legs to drive his cock in and out of you. With every thrust, his nuts slap against your buttocks, landing with a heavy thud.

He's got you on the edge from the start, but Byron's unrelenting pace brings you quick toward your climax. You pant against his chest, tongue catching droplets of his heady sweat with every breath you take. Your legs cramp as Byron's mammoth cock flattens your prostate. The bull doesn't even flinch as you scream in orgasm. Your abused hole flutters around his enormity as you spill your seed between your bodies.

"Byron, please..." You moan out. You don't even mean anything in particular by it, you just repeat his name over and over as he uses you.

Finally, you feel his breaths quicken and his body tenses up. He holds you even tighter, your flushed face against his pillowy pectorals. He groan as one of his nipples slip into your mouth and you roll your tongue against the fat nub. His thrusts come deeper, more purposeful. Then, he slams his manhood into you one last time, grinding his hips against yours.

Byron roars in triumph as he breeds you. He is an alpha who has claimed his mate, the rush of thick seed pouring into you brands you as his bitch forever. Your mouth lies open as wave after wave of gloopy, potent bull cum floods your innards. You can't see it, but you know how your belly is swelling up from being filled.

He stays hilted inside you as his orgasm abates, not once letting you move. The beast needs to fill and mark his little mate.

When the flow finally ceases, Byron rolls over to his side, pulling you with him. His cock twitches inside you still and you know he won't go soft for a long while yet.

Your face ends up resting on his bicep, one of his nipples still in your mouth. Neither of you say anything.

--

You don't remember at which part you blacked out, but you wake up before Byron does. Your face is pressed against his crotch. It takes you a moment to get your bearings, but you're soon acclimated to your position. When you move, you feel a sting in your ass, followed by a throb of warm pleasure. When he finished with you, Byron had shoved a plug into you. Not an ounce of his cum was going to waste, he would make you take it all. You move a hand back, grasping at the rubber handle. Closing your eyes, you breathe in the scent of sex and cum in the air. Your toes curl as you press gently on the plug, pushing it against your prostate. You know something that would feel even better than the toy, but you'll get it in due course.

Even though he's sound asleep, Byron's cock is rock hard. It throbs angrily against his stomach, drooling a slow stream of thick precum into his fur. Slowly, you encircle the behemoth with your hands. This is your only chance of taking your time to enjoy him. Once he wakes up, he's in charge. You cup your hand below his cock head, catching the fat globs of pre that ooze out. You bring it to your mouth, letting his sweet essence coat your palate. He tastes masculine, hinting at his power.

Letting his cock fall back against his stomach, you direct your attention to his swollen nuts. You lower your face between Byron's thick legs and stick your tongue out to run over one of his balls. The air is so thick you could cut it with a knife. You shudder and plant your face against his huge scrotum, greedily breathing in his potent musky scent. You can barely heft one of his nuts in one hand, and you slowly bathe his sac with your tongue. Miraculously, he still hasn't awoken. Ordinarily, Byron would be embarrassed to see you worship his body like this, but you know he wouldn't mind it now.

You make sure to coat all of his nuts in your saliva, lapping up as much of him as you can manage. You feel his massive testes move slowly as you handle them. You can't wait to taste more of him, but you'll have to work for your meal.

Against his stomach, Byron's cock is still slowly pulsing. You move around on the bed and straddle Byron's stomach, laying yourself over his bulk so your face is right against his dick.
