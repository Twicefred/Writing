# What Happened Last Night


*Adam and Hyde wake up happy and exhausted on New Year's Day, but what really happened last night? And who was the man they got to know so intimately?*

*I recently made the switch to writing in VS Code, and this story really felt like it wrote itself. I hope you enjoy it.*

*Comments, feedback and faves are greatly appreciated!*

Adam stared at the ceiling. New Years Day. It was dark outside. Him and Hyde had probably stumbled in at just after 7 in the morning, so he assumed it was late afternoon or early evening.

Closing his eyes, he patted the warm spot next to him. *‘Where’s he gone?’* Adam thought. His question was answered when he heard a faucet running in the next room. Shortly, the sound of dull claws against the hardwood floor alerted him to the presence of his boyfriend.

“Good morning, beautiful,” Adam said, grinning through the headache as a hungover German shepherd trotted over to the bed. He looked like a caricature of a sad dog, tail between his legs and all, though his ears perked up a bit at the sight of his boyfriend awake.

“Hey handsome,” Hyde said, setting a big glass of water down on the nightstand next to Adam. They looked at each other for a moment before neither of them could keep a straight face any longer. “You look horrible.” Hyde laughed as Adam took a big gulp of water. He had to take deep breaths to keep his stomach calm.

“I could say the same, you look like someone abandoned you by the roadside,” Adam said, sticking his tongue out at Hyde laying down next to him.

“That’s a big attitude for someone who can barely keep a sip of water down.” Hyde snuggled up next to Adam, sniffing the human’s hair as Adam laid his head against Hyde’s shoulder. “You smell like cigar smoke and sweat.” The German shepherd grimaced; the combination made his hungover stomach turn.

“Fat load of good that sensitive nose does you right now,” Adam replied, burying his face against Hyde’s fur. His human nose wasn’t as keen as Hyde’s military-grade sniffer, but he could make out the smoke and body fluids well enough.

Adam could remember most of last night’s festivities well enough. But he had to admit, some of the details *were* fuzzy.

*“What happened last night?”*

“Only one hour left!” Madeleine yelled over the music. Adam gave the red fox a thumbs-up. Him, Hyde, Madeleine and a handful others had decided to ring in the new year at the waterfront. The bay and the downtown skyline would be lit up by fireworks and Adam had heard rumours of a live band playing nearby at midnight.

Adam made his way to the kitchen to find where Hyde had gone off to. Rounding a corner, he walked into a solid wall of muscle. Taking a step back, he blinked and looked up to determine what he had collided with.

“Sorry, I didn’t see where I was going,” Adam said, his voice growing quieter as his gaze wandered up. A pair of dark brown eyes met his. Just above, a large pair of curled, gleaming white horns.

“Don’t worry, little guy,” The massive, pitch-black bull stared down at Adam for a second before cracking a wide grin and laughing. He had a deep, warm voice that made Adam feel at ease. “I should wear a warning sign, there’s a lot to walk into.” The bull patted his stomach and Adam smiled along with him. “Now what’s got you in such a hurry?”

“I’m just looking for my boyfriend;” Adam said, craning his neck to see around the bull. The kitchen was empty except the two of them. Adam noticed the tall bull was looking intently at him.

“Boyfriend, huh? Maybe I’ve seen him, what does he look like?”

“He’s a brown German shepherd, about as tall as your shoulder,” Adam said. He stood on his tiptoes, but much of the party crowd was still too tall for him to see past.

“Well, why don’t we go look for him together,” The bull said, resting a warm hand on Adam’s shoulder. “With two sets of eyes we’ll find him quick.”

“Sure,” Adam said, smiling as the bull led him out of the kitchen. “I’m Adam, what’s your name?”

“I’m Frey,” The bull said, squeezing his big arm around Adam. The crowd parted for them as they crossed the living room. It felt like they were floating past everyone, no one even looked at them as they walked by.

Soon enough, they found Hyde out on the balcony, looking out over the twinkling city lights.

“Hey there,” Adam said, walking over to his boyfriend. “Come for some peace and quiet?” Hyde nodded back.

“The music was getting a bit loud,” Hyde said, pulling Adam in for a hug. Something was different about him, though. His human didn’t smell like he usually did. There was something else there. Like he’d stood next to someone with a lit cigar.

“You must be Hyde,” Frey said, stepping through the shadows onto the balcony. For a split second, every hair on Hyde’s body stood straight out. The black-as-night body, those horns. The figure looked demonic. His fear was quickly assuaged as the bull walked slowly toward them. “Your boyfriend ran into me in the kitchen.”

“Nice to meet you,” Hyde stretched out his paw, and Frey shook it. The bull’s presence now felt more reassuring, soothing.

"Likewise," Frey said, joining Adam and Hyde in enjoying the vista. "Such a beautiful night, too." Adam and Hyde stood next to each other at the balcony railing, and Frey walked up just behind them. His gaze fell down on them both as he laid an arm on each boy's shoulder, enveloping them in a casual half-embrace.

Hyde and Adam backed up against Frey's chest, letting him hug them both. The bull's arms felt warm and comforting against the cold evening air, a fitting way to end the last moments of the year.

“Next year we’re going to a smaller party,” Hyde said, laying his head in Adam’s lap.

“Too noisy for you?” Adam said, scratching the fur around Hyde’s ears. Adam could never get enough of the soft fluff at the base of the canine’s ears, it just called out for him to fawn over. Hyde nodded and enjoyed the attention. It was great to be covered in fur when you had a partner to pet you. “Yeah, I see your point. Thought it’s still better than hosting one of our own. I can’t imagine the cleaning Madeleine will have on her hands today.”

“The point of having friends is that there’s always someone else willing to host the parties,” Hyde said, turning over to lay on his back. “We paid for most of the drinks, anyway.”

“How greedy you are,” Adam said, laughing together with Hyde. He grinned as the canine snuggled into his lap. ‘*He’s too easy,*’ Adam thought as he scratched Hyde’s neck, watching the big shepherd relax against him.

“Just looking for a good deal,” Hyde said, winking at his boyfriend. “Oh yes, keep doing that…” Hyde groaned in contentment as Adam ran his hands over his soft stomach. Hyde had just the right amount of fluffy fur and love of junk food to make sure Adam would spend hours giving him the attention he craved.

“Does someone like belly rubs?” Adam made a kissy face as his baby voice earned him an angry look. Hyde was big enough to comfortably carry the human around as he pleased, but Adam didn’t care. Hyde was his big puppy, and puppies got belly rubs. "You have to say it." Adam grinned, seeing Hyde's tortured expression.

"Please love," Hyde said, his eyes pleading wide. Adam didn't move an inch, he wasn't going to relent. "Yes, please give me more belly rubs." Hyde said quietly.

"I would never deny you," Adam said, leaning down to plant a kiss on Hyde's snout. Hyde quickly forgot his brief embarrassment when Adam once again ran both of his hands over his stomach.

"Did you make any new year's resolutions?" Hyde asked, looking up at Adam.

"None that I can remember. I had other things on my mind at midnight."

The clock struck twelve and the sky erupted with fireworks. By the waterfront, a crowd cheered and embraced each other as a new year began.

“Happy new year!” Hyde popped open a bottle of champagne and poured Adam and himself a glass each.

“Happy new year, my love,” Adam said, tilting his head up to kiss Hyde before they toasted. For a moment, they stood quietly and watched the fireworks. Some of the skyscrapers downtown had laser shows installed, and the blitz of sound and lights made for an impressive display.

“Happy new year, boys.” They turned around to see Frey was standing right behind them. Adam and Hyde had lost the bull somewhere in the process of getting from the party to the harbour, but he had found them again.

"Enjoying the show?" Frey asked, smiling down at them both.

"Yeah, it's beautiful," Hyde said, eyes wide as bursts of light filled the sky above them. The smell of gunpowder lay heavy in the air with smoke drifting in from where the fireworks had been launched.

They stood quiet for a while, watching the show together. Soon, the crowd was beginning to thin out. Madeleine and the others they had arrived with seemed to have gone their separate ways and they were left at the waterfront with Frey. The bull stood close behind Adam and Hyde, holding one hand on each of their shoulders.

"Should we go back to the party?" Adam asked.

"If you boys are interested, I have another idea," Frey said, smirking as Hyde and Adam looked at each other. They didn't need to ask him what he meant.

“I should call Madeleine and say thanks for inviting us,” Adam said, inspecting his face in the mirror. He needed to shave and shower, but other than that he was in one shape. Hyde looked a bit worse. His fur was pressed completely flat on one side of his face, and he had a piece of chewing gum stuck on his back. ‘*How’d that get there?*’ Adam thought as he watched Hyde paw at the gum, failing to remove it. “No, love. You’ll just tear your fur out,” Adam said, grabbing Hyde’s wrist.

“It’s really stuck,” Hyde said, whining as he craned his neck around to catch a glimpse of the unwelcome object in the mirror.

“Yeah, this is a tricky one,” Adam said, inspecting the speck of pink gum. Hyde had slept on it, working it into his fur. “Looks like we’ll just have to shave you smooth, sorry about that.”

“What?” Hyde turned around, eyes wide in terror before he saw Adam snickering at him. “You prick.”

“We’ll get it out in the shower, don’t worry,” Adam said, blowing Hyde a kiss before turning to the shower cubicle.

Once the water was hot, they stepped in together. Hyde relaxed against the glazed tile wall as Adam scrubbed him down. There were several spots on his legs where Hyde’s fur had clumped together, and Adam had to work his fingers through the knots and tangles to get them loose.

“He really did a number on you,” Adam said, grinning as he brushed out the wet fur. Hyde winced as Adam untangled the last piece and stood up.

"I thought it would be worse, it can be impossible to get out..."

"We should have asked to shower there," Adam said, washing the previous night off his skin. "Then again, do you even remember how we got there?"

“So, what do you do for a living?” Adam asked as Frey led them into the building. A uniformed goat guarding the door briefly looked them over, but went back to his newspaper when Frey nodded to him.

“I’m in law enforcement,” Frey replied. At some point, Frey had draped his arms over Adam and Hyde, holding them to his sides.

“You’re a policeman?” Hyde said as they stopped in front of the elevator.

“Not quite, pup,” Frey said, his fingers slowly stroking the soft fur around Hyde’s neck. Hyde leaned into his grasp, relaxing against the bull’s big arm. “I work in corrections. If you’ve been bad, you get sent to me.” Hyde froze as Frey’s eyes bored into his own. The bull had such an entrancing gaze, it pulled him in effortlessly.

“I bet you could show us many ways to restrain someone,” Adam interjected as the elevator doors dinged. The bull led them into the elevator before turning his warm eyes to Adam instead.

“Of course, but I wouldn’t want to lock you two cuties up,” Frey said, hugging the two smaller figures to his chest. “Besides, you’re not bad, are you? I think you’re going to be such good boys for me.”

The elevator doors opened again and Frey led them down a long hallway. He unlocked a door and they stepped into an expensively decorated apartment.

“Make yourselves at home,” Frey said, closing the door behind them. The floor creaked under his hooves as he motioned for Adam and Hyde to join him. They were pulled along into a large living room, the centre of which was a red velvet sofa opposite a fireplace. Dark bookshelves lined the walls, complete with a sliding ladder to reach the top shelf. Frey probably didn’t need it, however.

Frey sat down in the middle of the sofa, motioning for Adam and Hyde to sit down on either side of him. The two boys were like moths to a flame. It felt nice and reassuring to have Frey’s strong arms holding them both.

“Now, I think we’re all in the open about why you’re here,” Frey said, holding his two new lovers. He smelled like tobacco and old leather. “But I want my boys to be happy and safe, so if you feel uncomfortable at any time, just tell me.” Frey looked at them both and they nodded their understanding.

“Where do I begin, then?” Frey said, leaning back against the thick cushions behind him. He had two boys to choose from, and they both looked good enough to eat up. Adam found himself chosen first. Frey had to lean down substantially to reach the human. Once their faces connected, Adam found himself desperately pushing back against Frey, wanting more of the bull instantly.

Frey had such a big tongue compared to Adam, it filled his mouth and pushed down to his throat immediately. The bull drooled copious amounts into Adam’s mouth, growling in delight as the human swallowed. Frey tasted like bourbon, a smooth yet large flavour that warmed Adam to the core. Adam pushed his lithe body against Frey’s muscular side, happily moaning as Frey’s large hand groped him. The bull breathed heavily against Adam’s face, leaving the human constantly awash with his presence.

Hyde lay his head against Frey’s thick chest, watching as his boyfriend made out with Frey. He felt no jealousy, he knew he’d get his turn. In the meantime, he busied himself with feeling up the bull’s monumental frame. Hyde wasn’t small by any means, but Frey put him to shame.

Frey’s hand on his head encouraged Hyde as he unbuttoned the bull’s shirt, exposing the pitch black, short fur to the world. Frey shrugged his shirt off, still not breaking his kiss with Adam. Immediately, Hyde’s sensitive nose was assaulted by the bull’s masculine scent. He took a deep breath, head reeling as Frey’s insistent hand pushed the shepherd against the bull’s exposed armpit.
Frey groaned in pleasure as he felt Hyde’s long tongue rake over his sweaty pit. Hyde felt like his entire being had been condensed down to the feeling of Frey’s musk short-circuiting his head. The bull smelled so strongly, and seeing him dominate Adam’s mouth had the shepherd panting with need.

Adam, meanwhile, did his best to hang on for the ride. Frey’s thick, slippery tongue was a constant presence in his throat, and the bull’s thick fingers had wandered down beneath the waistline in his pants. Thinking of how big the bull must be had him pushing his butt out with need. Adam wasn’t one to back down from a challenge.

When Frey finally broke the kiss, Adam was breathing heavily from exertion. He felt like he had been deep-throating a live snake. He swallowed hard and licked his lips, feeling the bull’s heady saliva in his mouth.

"Look at that, we got the puppy all zonked out," Frey said, pulling Hyde from his rank pit. Hyde's mouth was open, tongue lolled out in a loopy grin. "Come here, I want to taste you too." Frey pulled Hyde toward him, capturing the shepherd's muzzle in his own. Hyde was bigger than Adam, so Frey had to work harder to dominate him, but he soon had the shepherd obediently sucking on his fat tongue.

Meanwhile, Adam had a new goal. Watching as Frey took his boyfriend to task, he slid to his knees in front of the bull's spread legs. He inched closer, running his hands along Frey's tight, navy blue trousers. When he closed the distance completely, the heat between the bull's legs felt sweltering. Adam took a deep breath and pressed his face against the bull's crotch. Immediately, he felt the contours of the barely contained leviathan in front of him. Frey groaned as Adam's small lips mouthed the outline of his manhood, sizing him up.

"Go ahead, unwrap it," Frey growled between kisses. Adam watched in delight as Frey held Hyde in a vice grip against his lips. The shepherd's tail was steadily thumping against the couch cushions, indicating his enjoyment.

With some initial difficulty, Adam managed to pry open the buttons in front of him. Frey lifted himself slightly, and Adam slid off the bull's slacks. As soon as he'd done that, he drew a ragged breath at the sight in front of him.

Frey was wearing a bright red jockstrap. It stood in stark contrast to the abyssal black of his fur, and perfectly accentuated the proportions of his oversized package. Slowly, wanting to experience it just right, Adam moved closer. The bull's manhood throbbed in anger behind the mesh fabric. It felt clear as ever why Frey was in charge here.

"Oh, fuck..." Adam moaned as he leant forward, letting his breath was over Frey's package. He had to taste it. He didn't need to confirm for himself, he knew Frey's dark eyes were on him as his tongue made contact with the bull's clothed dick. Adam could have come right then and there. The taste was rapturous, a perfect encapsulation of the word 'masculine'. And this was *before* Frey even got fully naked.

Enjoying every stroke of his tongue on the musk-laced fabric, Adam slowly bathed Frey's crotch in his saliva. It felt like a miracle that the jock hadn't burst at the seams yet. With Frey's every heartbeat, his manhood pulsed and jumped against Adam's face, straining to break free. Adam hooked his thumbs into the waistband of Frey's jockstrap, but the bull halted him. Adam looked up at him, wanting an explanation for his denial.

"Don't get ahead of yourself, little buddy," Frey said, extracting his long tongue from Hyde's throat. "I like it when my boys show some team spirit. Don't you want to share with your boyfriend?" Frey grinned as Adam eagerly nodded. Hyde blinked slowly, only now realising he was supposed to do something different.

"Why don't the two of you get your cute butts out of those clothes, and I'll give you both all the man you can handle..." Frey said, groping his manhood through the spit-soaked jockstrap.

Adam and Hyde both eagerly obeyed. They smiled at each other as they disrobed, leaving their clothes on the couch next to Frey. Finally, they were both naked. Frey pointed one finger toward the floor, and they both kneeled.

Frey looked at the two eager boys and lifted himself slightly off the couch. In one stroke, he pulled his jockstrap down and off. Leaning forward, he grabbed Adam and Hyde's heads and pulled them forward. Both inhaled deeply as Frey sandwiched his massive erection between their heads. It was just like the rest of his body. Black as tar with prominent veins running across the shaft. Below, two orange-sized tested slowly undulating in their sac. No doubt ready to fill whoever Frey wanted to bursting.

"Come on boys, get a good taste," Frey said, stroking the back of his two boys' heads. Adam and Hyde's eyes met across the bull's thick manhood, looking at each other in excitement. They'd involved a third player before, but no one had come close to matching what Frey had to offer. They both eagerly kissed the length of Frey's shaft, working together toward the tip. They could see thick pearls of glossy precum dripping from the ridged head, and they both wanted to see what the taste would be like.

"There you go, good boys share with each other," Frey said as Adam and Hyde's tongues met at the tip. The heady taste of the bull's precum exploded in their mouths as they made out over Frey's cock. The taste and Frey's encouraging hands spurred them on. Soon it was a competition to see who would get which part of the bull's dick. Hyde's larger muzzle won the dripping head, and he was soon at work noisily slurping down the fat drops of pre as they came.

Adam decided on a different target. He ducked under Hyde and stuck his face against Frey's massive nuts. He shuddered as his tongue made contact with the furred testicles. They were soaked through with spit and the bull's potent musky sweat. Frey spread his legs wide to accommodate both worshipping boys, occasionally rewarding them with grunts of approval and nudges on their heads to get them to focus on the parts where he wanted them.

"That's it, you're doing so well," Frey said, encouraging them both. He laid one of his hands on the back of Hyde's neck, pulling the shepherd further and further down onto his dick. Soon, he had Hyde bobbing his head up and down, Frey's mammoth cock slipping in and out of his throat. Every stroke rewarding Hyde with another pearlescent drop of precum and an approving look from above.

Meanwhile, Adam was busy getting blissed out on Frey's bull nuts. There was just so much area to cover, and each part tasted just as good. His small tongue raked over every centimetre of the furred, loose skin. He briefly wanted to try fitting one of them in his mouth, but that was a doomed prospect from the beginning. He settled for licking and sucking the skin into his mouth instead, rewarding his taste buds with the bull's potent musky taste.

They both could have stayed like that for hours.

"I ordered pizza!" Adam had to raise his voice over the sound of the full-body hairdryer running. Adam could just towel off, but Hyde was endowed with a more furry disposition, so he had to take extra steps. Adam turned on some music on the stereo in the living room. Some ambient sounds to fill the void when the hairdryer turned off. He heard the sound of claws against bathroom tile and turned around.

"Here we go," Hyde said, rolling his eyes but smiling at the attention he was due. Adam bounded across the room, grinning like a clown at the sight of Hyde freshly blow-dried.

"How can you be this floofy!" Adam laughed, burying his face against Hyde's chest. Hyde was quite shaggy, so fresh out of the shower he became a cloud of creamy brown fur that drifted through their apartment. Hyde tried to play it cool, but with his tail wagging it was difficult to hide his enjoyment.

Their food wouldn't arrive for almost another hour, so they made for the sofa. Adam had to be led across the living room, still enraptured with Hyde's maximal fluff. Sitting down on the sofa, they both winced in soreness.

"Got you good last night, huh?" Hyde said, laughing as Adam tried to adjust his position to be more comfortable.

"I think we both got as much as we could handle."

## Break

"Go on, boy. I need you to prepare him for me," Frey said, encouraging Adam. All three were on Frey's enormous bed. Frey was stretched out with his head on the pillows, Hyde was on top of him, moaning with his tongue lapping at one of Frey's nipples. Adam was behind him, with his hard cock pointed at the shepherd's stretched hole. Frey had spent considerable time eating him out, making Hyde beg for his boyfriend's dick, knowing it would eventually get him to Frey's. "You're so ready, aren't you, pup?" Frey asked, scratching the shepherd's ear.

"Please, fuck me, Adam," Hyde begged, sticking his ass out with his tail raised. The shepherd moaned as Adam slowly pushed inside. Adam breathed heavily as he draped his body on top of Hyde's. The shepherd's tailhole caressed his dick like a velvet-clad vice. Adam's whole body shivered as he worked his hips back and forth. Frey was watching him intently, offering encouraging words and stroking Hyde's cheek when he cried out in pleasure. "Harder, please, I need it!" Hyde bottomed less than Adam did, but when he did he turned into a stereotype.

"What a needy pup you are," Frey said, feeding his thick fingers into Hyde's muzzle. Hyde obediently suckled on the offered digits. It silenced his loud moans somewhat. The only other sounds audible in the room was the slapping of Adam's hips against Hyde's furry cheeks and the squishing from his generously lubricated hole. "Don't worry, me and your stud boyfriend will give you everything you can handle."

Adam grunted as he slammed his cock inside Hyde. The shepherd's hole rippled across his length and he didn't know how long he could hold out. He laid his head against Hyde's back, feeling the soft fur against his cheek. Hyde whined in pleasure every time Adam's dick nudged against his prostate. As he pistoned in and out of his boyfriend, Adam felt Frey's large hand against the back of his head. He looked up, immediately caught in the bull's magnetic gaze.

"Cum for me, Adam," Frey said as Adam thrust fully inside his boyfriend. As he did, he felt his balls draw up tight. He groaned in pleasure as he spent his seed inside the shepherd's spasming hole. "Good boy, flood this slut. He's our little fuckpuppy tonight, isn't he?"

With a squishy sound, Adam rolled off of Hyde's back. They both breathed heavily, Hyde could feel drips of Adam's seed leak out of his stretched hole and run down his taint.

"My turn," Frey said, lifting Hyde off his stomach and laying him belly up beside Adam. Hyde gulped, looking at Frey as he got into position. Adam was decently endowed for a human, but Frey was a titan in comparison. The bull lifted Hyde's legs up, folding the shepherd in two. Adam held one of Hyde's paws as Frey laid the tip of his dick against Hyde's slowly pulsing hole. A dollop of creamy human seed flowed out, and Frey spread it around with his bulbous cockhead. "Don't worry, pup. This is going to feel so good."

Hyde's eyes fluttered closed as Frey pushed inside the shepherd's well exercised tailhole. Every vein and ripple on the enormous pole sent shivers through his taut hole. It pushed against every nerve ending he had, stimulating him deliciously. Hyde whined and squeezed Adam's hand, looking at his awestruck boyfriend as Frey slowly fed his cock inside him. When Frey had bottomed out fully, Hyde felt fuller than he had ever been. His own cock was poking out of his sheath, slowly drooling precum onto his stomach.

Adam leaned in to capture Hyde's lips as Frey began to move his dick in and out. The shepherd desperately kissed him back as the massive bull member rearranged his insides. Hyde felt like a vessel for Frey's enormity, a smaller person being blessed with the presence of a God.

Frey grunted in pleasure as Hyde's tight hole massaged his dick. The two boyfriends were eagerly making out while he fucked one of them. Adam broke the kiss to look back at the delicious debauchery. With every thrust, he could see movement on Hyde's stomach. '*I wonder what he would look like inside me,*' Adam though, laying his hand against the moving bulge.

"You'll get to feel it too," Frey said, smiling down at Adam. He stabbed in harder, breathing hard as Hyde wailed in pleasure. "Why don't you do something about that loud mouth of his?"

Adam knew what to do. He sidled up to Hyde's face, tapping the shepherd's muzzle to tell him to open. He got into position and slid his dick into Hyde's maw. He squirmed as Hyde's long tongue slurped against his cock, eagerly cleaning off the cum that still clung onto Adam from the earlier breeding. Still, one more thing was on Adam's mind.

He laid himself down over Hyde's stomach, pressing his cock into the shepherd's warm muzzle. He was perfectly in front of Hyde's drooling sheath. He could see the tip of the thick, angry red cock poking out. Adam stuck his tongue out, scooping up a thick drop of pre and letting it coat his palate. Sublime.

Hyde moaned around the cock in his mouth as Adam craned his neck forward. Hyde's entire package throbbed as Adam made out with his sheath, running his tongue inside and around the thick tube of furred meat. Hyde's cock was growing steadily with the barrage of stimulation, and Adam soon had his mouth full.

Not to be outdone, Frey kept a steady pace, thrusting in and out of Hyde with the precision of a machine. Every stroke hit the shepherd's prostate perfectly, delivering a fat glob of precum onto Adam's tongue. Spurred on by Frey's hard thrusts, Adam opened his mouth as wide as he could and went down on Hyde's rock hard dick.

Hyde cried out in pleasure around Adam's cock as he was deep-throated expertly by his boyfriend. At the same time, Frey's gargantuan manhood smashed in and out of his tight hole. Hyde didn't last very long under the double onslaught. Adam saw his release coming and went as deep as he could, the tapered tip of Hyde's thick canine member deep in his oesophagus. Frey lent a helping hand, laying his thick fingers around the base of Hyde's cock. He grinned and squeezed around the swelling knot as Hyde's hips shook in climax.

Adam didn't have the opportunity to swallow. He only held his breath as Hyde whimpered and shot wave after wave of thick, fertile seed into his stomach. Adam was familiar with the nutty, rich taste. Hyde was nothing if not productive, and soon Adam felt his stomach grow pleasantly full. He pulled back somewhat, letting the last few waves of canine cum splash into his mouth. He swirled his tongue around the tip of Hyde's thick member, sucking down every ounce he could milk from the shepherd's dick.

He pulled off and let Hyde's cock fall back against the shepherd's precum-slick stomach. He slowly licked down the still hard shaft, planting little kisses along the angry red surface. As he came down from his climax, Hyde was still lazily suckling on Adam's cock.

"Look at you boys," Frey said. He'd kept up his crushing pace, grinding his thick member into Hyde's well-stretched hole. The shepherd whined as Frey thrust in even harder. "You ready to get filled, pup?"

Hyde nodded, and Adam pulled his dick out of his muzzle, letting his boyfriend breathe.

Frey drew a sharp breath and quickened his pace. Every time he slammed inside was like crackling thunder, shaking Hyde's entire body. Then at last, he buried his entire length inside Hyde's trembling hole. Frey's eyes shot wide and he threw his head back, a bellowing roar building from his stomach as his enormous balls drew tight.

Hyde groaned as he felt Frey's cock jump and throb inside him. The bull's member swelled even harder and a flash flood of cum burst forth into the shepherd's waiting body. Adam watched in disbelief as Frey held Hyde's hips in a vice grip. A noticeable bulge was forming on the base of Hyde's stomach. Hyde felt every wave of scalding hot cum fill his guts. He'd never felt anything like it, the sensation of his belly expanding to greedily accept every drop of bull cum was amazing.

Frey's orgasm lasted for well over a minute, filling Hyde to a degree that neither him nor Adam thought possible. When it finally ended, Hyde's belly was swollen like he had swallowed a melon. Adam laid a hand against his stretched boyfriend, feeling the shepherd's stomach slosh with Frey's seed.

"Feels so good..." Hyde moaned. He'd taken big men before, but this redefined the sensation of being filled. He groaned as Adam's hands massaged his substantial cum belly. Adam couldn't get enough of feeling the thick, gloopy fluid move and gurgle beneath his hands.

"I'm doing you next," Frey said, fixating Adam in his gaze. Adam nodded. He wanted to feel that good, too.

Slowly, Frey pulled his thick cock from Hyde's gaping hole. The room stunk of his sweat and seed. Adam watched in fascination as globs of thick cum escaped Hyde's stretched tailhole. Some still oozed from Frey's semi-hard member. The bull laid down on the bed, motioning for Adam to get on top of him.

"Clean me off while we get you ready," He said, pulling Adam's smaller body onto his. Adam found himself face to face with Frey's veined manhood. It was already hardening again. Adam stuck his tongue out and ran it down the mammoth shaft, slurping up thick drops of cum as he went. It tasted amazing. Sweet, rich, large in character. The taste dominated his senses just as ably as Frey had played both him and Hyde so far. Adam was so focused on his task at hand that he was completely unprepared for the bull's broad tongue landing on his own exposed hole.

Frey chuckled as Adam threw his head back in pleasure. He wasted no time, spearing his thick tongue into the human's tight hole. He didn't have anyone else to help him prepare this time. Hyde was out of commission, he wasn't good for much other than looking fucked out for the next while.

"You're gonna look so cute when you're all filled up," Frey said, stretching Adam's tiny hole with his thick fingers. "Just like your boyfriend. What a couple you are, getting fucked out together..."

Adam didn't reply, he was too busy cleaning off every millimetre of Frey's enormous cock. The pitch black member glistened with his saliva dripping from it, slowly throbbing against his tongue. Just beyond his reach, Adam could see Frey's enormous balls resting against the mattress. He couldn't wait to feel Frey's manhood inside him.

"That should do it," Frey said, pulling his fingers out of Adam's backside. Reluctantly, Adam let Frey's cock drop from his mouth. He was as ready as he'd ever be, but riding the bull was going to be a challenge. Adam lay down on his back, his head level with Hyde's.

"Help us out here, pup," Frey said, motioning at Hyde. The shepherd eagerly complied, pulling Adam's head in for a kiss. It was exactly the distraction Frey had wanted, and once he saw the two lovers making out, he positioned the head of his dick at Adam's hole. Wasting no time, he bucked his strong hips forward, popping the bulbous head inside Adam's tight ass.

Adam breathed in sharply as he felt Frey's gargantuan cock snake inside him. Miraculously, he felt barely any pain. Soon, he felt Frey's hips snugly against his own. The pressure inside him was otherworldly, a presence like nothing he'd ever experienced.

"Oh my god..." Adam groaned as he met Frey's gaze. The bull had him utterly transfixed. With every heartbeat, the Frey's cock throbbed against Adam's prostate, forcing shivers of electric pleasure through the human's small body.

Hyde laid a paw against Adam's stomach, feeling the thick bulge created by Frey's titan manhood. Adam clenched his fists against the mattress as Frey slowly pulled his cock back. He let it pop completely free, watching as Adam's hole gaped wide open.

"Oh fuck..." Adam moaned as Frey pushed back inside, watching as his stomach filled out from the massive intruder. Frey kept up the slow pace, letting Adam adjust somewhat to the sensation. With every stroke, Adam's own cock jumped, drooling small drops of precum onto his slick stomach.

Frey grunted and hilted himself fully inside. Laying his strong arms around Adam's torso, he lifted the him into his lap. Adam wrapped his legs around Frey's waist, letting himself sink deeper onto the massive cock. Frey grabbed his waist with both hands and lifted Adam slowly off his cock. Gravity did the job on the way down.

Adam cried out in pleasure as he was bounced up and down on Frey's oversized member. At first, he had his arms around the bull's strong neck, but to get better leverage he grabbed Frey's thick horns instead. Frey leered at him as Adam willingly let himself be bounced like a toy. Their eyes never left each other, Frey's hypnotic gaze completely entranced Adam.

"I'm going to flood you, Adam," Frey whispered, watching as Adam gasped and cried with every stroke. "You'll never forget what it feels like." Hyde watched from just beside them, stroking his full belly contentedly.

"Please... It feels so good..." Adam whimpered as Frey slammed his entire body down onto his cock. His toes curled as Frey bucked into him, hitting his prostate just right. Adam cried as he came for the second time, his load spilling out between him and Frey. Frey snorted, his hot breath washing over Adam's face as the bull prepared for his own climax.

Adam's small hole rippled and pulsed over Frey's manhood. Frey held Adam tight to his body, mashing the human's face against his sweaty chest. And he came.

With a roar that shook the room, Frey's titanic bull cock pulsed inside Adam's too small ass. Adam's mouth hung open in slack amazement as he felt a torrent of seed erupt into him. One wave and he felt full, another one was unreal. Frey didn't stop there, he wouldn't stop until Adam was as full as Hyde.

Steadily, Adam's stomach swelled outward with warmth. Frey poured every ounce of his dominance into the smaller human, not letting up until Adam was filled to bursting.

"Holy shit..." Adam whispered as Frey laid him down on the bed next to Hyde. He felt like he'd swallowed a beach ball. With every tiny movement, his swollen stomach jiggled obscenely. Frey stayed embedded inside him, watching as Adam and Hyde found each other's lips. Two filled-up boys making out as their top watched in pride.

They would never forget him. He'd made sure of that.

## Break

"Did you ever get his last name?" Hyde asked. He lay on his back against Adam, lazily opening his maw to let Adam feed him a slice of pizza.

"No, I never thought to ask," Adam said, picking up another slice and eating it himself. Hyde looked longingly at the junk food. "I'm not letting you eat all the pizza by yourself. Gluttony is a sin, you know?" Hype yipped as Adam pinched his stomach and laughed.

"Low blow," He sulked, but happily opened up when Adam gave him the next slice. "Then again," Hyde said with his maw full of pizza. "Even if we did get his name or number, I'm not sure when I'd be ready for that again."

"You have no problem filling up on calories," Adam teased him, dangling a pizza slice above Hyde's face.

"Did you take a sass pill when I wasn't looking?" Hyde laughed, craning his neck to snatch the pizza from Adam's hand.

"Can't let you be the only one here with a big mouth," Adam said, scratching Hyde's neck as they relaxed against each other. All in all, the new year was off to a good start.
