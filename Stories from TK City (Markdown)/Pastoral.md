# Pastoral - Patrician

Old houses on the countryside, summer innocence but freed from naïveté, long evenings on the front porch listening to the birds. The sound of crickets in the night. Going for a swim in the old sandstone quarry at night.

Setting: Old house in the countryside. Inland, continental European landscape. Robust oak trees and rapeseed fields.

Characters:
    Gerard Barr - Red Fox. Gerard is an ambitious, career-focused person. He works as a corporate realtor, specialising in office space for large corporations. Due to the nature of his work, he is often consumed totally for months at a time, during which he has little time for other concerns. Gerard enjoys his work, but laments the fact that he loses himself in it.

    Ricard Xavier - Human. Ricard is the editor of a struggling newspaper. Though he pours his heart and soul into the business, it is becoming more and more clear that the company will not make it. While their personal livelihoods aren't at stake with Gerard earning substantially more, Ricard finds the circumstances difficult. He knows that Gerard wants to support them both and is happy to do so, but he cannot shake the feeling that he isn't bringing enough to the table. Ultimately, Ricard is going through loss of a different kind.

    Patricia Barr - Red Fox. Gerard's older sister who died in a car accident two months after their mother's passing. Patricia took responsibility for their mother's estate, knowing that Gerard was seasonally busy with work. She had intended to clean out and sell Mona's old house and split the proceeds with her brother, but died herself before she could complete the process. With her death, the entire estate passes to Gerard.

    Mona Barr - Red Fox. Gerard's deceased mother. Mona was close to both her children, but due to living far away they didn't meet very often. While visiting friends in a nearby village, Mona suffered a heart attack and died in the hospital shortly after. Patricia was with her at the end, but despite driving through the night, Gerard didn't make it until the day after.

Synopsis: After the death of Mona, Gerard's mother, him and his fiancé Ricard visit the fox's childhood home that he has inherited. The house hasn't been inhabited for half a year, and the return of childhood memories and familiar surroundings weigh heavily on them. The story is about coping with and overcoming loss, and facing parts of the past that you might not wish to return to, even if in hindsight you might think differently of them.

Chapter 1:
    Gerard and Ricard arrive at Gerard's childhood home in the countryside. With his mother having passed away, Gerard has inherited the house and land. The house is surrounded by forest and farmland. Nearby is an abandoned quarry that has since flooded, a spot where Gerard and his big sister Patricia used to go swimming when they were young. The nearest neighbours are a farmer and his wife 10 minutes away by car, though they were never close to the family.
