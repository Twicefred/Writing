# Pastoral - Patrician

Old houses on the countryside, summer innocence but freed from naïveté, long evenings on the front porch listening to the birds. The sound of crickets in the night. Going for a swim in the old sandstone quarry at night.

Setting: Old house in the countryside. Inland, continental European landscape. Robust oak trees and rapeseed fields.

The house is as much a character as Francis and Ricard. It is an old wooden villa, painted yellow with white accents. Due to age and general neglect, the house is in some decline, with flaking paint and creaking floorboards. Still, it is in good condition and would look as good as new with some light renovations.
The house has two floors and an attic. On the first floor is the living room, kitchen, dining room and Mona's indoor garden and sunroom. Mona was a passionate gardener, and kept a garden full of fruits and herbs for use in cooking. Her indoor garden was for flowers and delicate plants from further south.
The living room has Mona's favourite rocking chair and a small TV. A large chintz sofa sits along one wall, next to a gramophone and a shelf of old records. A cheap chandelier hangs in the middle.
The kitchen and dining room are adjoined. The kitchen is spacious with a large stove and a very old refrigerator that makes loud noises in the night.

The second floor has the master bedroom, and Francis's and Patricia's old bedrooms. Patricia's bedroom was converted into a room for Mona's painting and other hobbies, while Francis's became a guest room. Francis and Ricard choose to sleep in the guest room, finding the master bedroom a weird place to sleep.

The attic has nothing but dust, darkness and old things piled in boxes. Francis's and Patricia's childhood clothes are there, as are their old toys. In the back is a locked safe with Mona's most personal belongings. Francis and Ricard spend considerable time trying to find the key.

The house is surrounded by a large garden. Mona kept fruit trees and an herb garden, though everything is overgrown. Ricard takes an interest in the garden and begins bringing it back to shape. North of the house is the orchard. West is the herb garden and other useful plants. South is the driveway and the main entrance, with a large porch looking out over the drive. East is Mona's flower garden, with roses and lilac creating a maze-like environment that eventually lead to a greenhouse. Inside is a table and four chairs, a perfect spot for autumn and early spring when the weather is colder.

About 15 minutes away by bicycle is an abandoned limestone quarry. It has long since been flooded, and is a perfect spot for bathing. The water has filtered through the stone and is a bright, tropical blue. The quarry is surrounded by oak forest, and only a few abandoned buildings lay nearby from the time that the quarry was active.

Characters:
    Francis Barr - Red Fox. Francis is an ambitious, career-focused person. He works as a corporate realtor, specialising in office space for large corporations. Due to the nature of his work, he is often consumed totally for months at a time, during which he has little time for other concerns. Francis enjoys his work, but laments the fact that he loses himself in it.
        Francis is more of a "dry" personality than his bohemian partner, though he isn't afraid to meet Ricard on even terms. After finishing a large deal and securing a promotion, he is forced by his boss to take a vacation, which prompts the visit to Mona's house.

    Ricard Xavier - Human. Ricard is the editor of a struggling newspaper. Though he pours his heart and soul into the business, it is becoming more and more clear that the company will not make it. While their personal livelihoods aren't at stake with Francis earning substantially more, Ricard finds the circumstances difficult. He knows that Francis wants to support them both and is happy to do so, but he cannot shake the feeling that he isn't bringing enough to the table. Ultimately, Ricard is going through loss of a different kind.
        Ricard is an artist at heart. He enjoys the finer things in life, and knows to pester Francis into enjoying them with him when the Fox is working too much. He can often be found with a book and an ice cold drink on a summer day, or working on a complicated recipe in the kitchen. Ironically, the loss of his livelihood has presented him with a mountain of free time that he's desperately trying to fill. Arriving at Mona's house, with no internet access or outside stimuli, proves initially difficult.

    Patricia Barr - Red Fox. Francis's older sister who died in a car accident two months after their mother's passing. Patricia took responsibility for their mother's estate, knowing that Francis was seasonally busy with work. She had intended to clean out and sell Mona's old house and split the proceeds with her brother, but died herself before she could complete the process. With her death, the entire estate passes to Francis.

    Mona Barr - Red Fox. Francis's deceased mother. Mona was close to both her children, but due to living far away they didn't meet very often. While visiting friends in a nearby village, Mona suffered a heart attack and died in the hospital shortly after. Patricia was with her at the end, but despite driving through the night, Francis didn't make it until the day after.

Synopsis: After the death of Mona, Francis's mother, him and his fiancé Ricard visit the fox's childhood home that he has inherited. The house hasn't been inhabited for half a year, and the return of childhood memories and familiar surroundings weigh heavily on them. The story is about coping with and overcoming loss, and facing parts of the past that you might not wish to return to, even if in hindsight you might think differently of them.

Chapter 1:
    Francis and Ricard arrive at Francis's childhood home in the countryside. With his mother having passed away, Francis has inherited the house and land. The house is surrounded by forest and farmland. Nearby is an abandoned quarry that has since flooded, a spot where Francis and his big sister Patricia used to go swimming when they were young. The nearest neighbours are a farmer and his wife 10 minutes away by car, though they were never close to the family.
