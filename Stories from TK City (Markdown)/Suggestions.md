_Unanswered love is the most painful love of all. For years, Jim has resigned himself to longingly gaze at his best friend, who remains completely unaware of his predicament. When an opportunity to change things up presents itself, Jim wastes no time in realising his dark fantasies, but ends up getting more than he bargained for._

_If a magical artefact falls into your possession, it’s my hope that you use it less selfishly than Jim. The premise of this story is ethically dubious to say the least. If this makes you uneasy, consider yourself warned._

“So, how’s life with the special needs student?” Sira said, snickering quietly across the table from me. I folded my arms across my chest and looked at her in annoyance.

“He’s my friend, I’d rather you didn’t talk about him like that,” I said, watching as the red fox idly scratched at the tuft of fur sticking out from under her shirt collar. “And he’s doing quite well for himself, if you must know. It wasn’t his fault that his girlfriend kicked him out, she was a real piece of work.”

“Not his fault? Jennifer had him out on his ass because she couldn’t stand another day with a person who’s that dense!” Sira said, growing annoyed at me in turn. “Their relationship was none of my business, but if you seriously think it was only her fault that it worked out the way it did, Lex isn’t the only one who would benefit from a few extra IQ points.”

We were discussing my childhood friend and current tenant, Lex McCormack. His ex-girlfriend had kicked him out of her house a while past, and since then he had been staying at my apartment. It wasn’t an arrangement entirely out of empathy, I did have a spare room and could use the extra rent money.
The issue with Lex was that he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed. In fact, a person with a less friendly disposition toward him might describe Lex as staggeringly dumb. Having known him for well over 20 years, I wouldn’t use that language, but it wasn’t exactly wrong.

His saving grace was that Lex was difficult to dislike if you got close to him. He had a warm personality, and an ironclad loyalty to those he loved. Losing everything when Jennifer, the cruel witch that she was, cut him off, had utterly broken him. I found out that it had happened when he appeared outside my door at night with a suitcase, asking me through heavy sobs if he could stay with me for a while.
Naturally, I couldn’t refuse his request and he had been renting my spare room for three months now.

“Sira, can we not fight about this? I’m really not in the mood.” I said, taking a drink from my glass of wine. She nodded, taking a sip of wine herself. We sat quietly for a few minutes, unconsciously avoiding eye contact. I fiddled with my wristwatch, idly watching Sira swish her tail behind her, narrowly avoiding getting herself tangled into the people walking past us.

The rest of our afternoon together passed with relative ease. The two of us had our disagreements, but we’d known each other for long enough to get past it. By the end, Sira handed me the bag she’d brought with her. The last of Lex’s belongings discovered by Jennifer as she was selling her house.

“I’ll speak to you later, I need to get home and prepare for work.” I said, embracing Sira and planting a kiss on her cheek as we parted. She waved goodbye to me as I walked off, carrying the heavy weekend bag over my shoulder.

Lex wasn’t there when I got home, which was probably just as well. I knew he’d be sad seeing the bag of clothes and personal items. I also knew he’d want some time alone to go through it and come to terms with it. If he wanted my help, he’d ask for it.

I put the bag in his room and jotted down a quick note to go with it. ‘Here’s the last of the things from before. Sira says hello. Let me know if you want to talk about it. – Jim’.

I sighed and closed the door, heading over to my own bedroom. I had switched shifts with a co-worker, leaving me to cover a night shift. I worked as a museum custodian, which mainly entailed making sure that children didn’t smudge up any valuable paintings. Tonight, I was being asked to patrol the galleries to spot any signs of trouble. Not that I would be able to stop any intruder if there was one. The museum guards didn’t carry any kind of weapon, and being a human standing at a measly 1,6 metres tall, a thief would hardly be intimidated.

I’d long since come to terms with my unimpressive stature and didn’t particularly care that many people treated me worse because of it. This was, however, something that had made my friendship with Lex difficult at times.

Lex was a bull. Literally and figuratively. Commanding an imposing 2,7 metres of length and being more akin to a walking landscape fixture in size than a mere man, we were nothing short of opposites. When we were young, I’d felt jealous of him. Despite outshining him academically, he was always more popular than I was. It came to a head when he found me in the school bathroom, crying over being beat up by an older boy. In my frustration, I’d yelled and berated him for having advantages I didn’t, and he left me alone.

We didn’t speak for a week after that, and I thought that I had irrevocably ruined our friendship. He proved me wrong however, when he saved me from being cornered by the same guy. We’d been inseparable friends since then, and having a massive bull at my side did make my school years better.

This was also a powerful catalyst for my growing awareness of my own sexuality. As a young man, I had ignored and bottled up what I felt when I saw Lex. Over a period of two years, I gradually grew to realise I preferred other guys, finding no excitement in the girls that the other boys fawned over. Moreover, I had developed a crush on my best friend.

Watching him as he walked, seeing his powerful body in gym class, and once walking in on him completely naked had fuelled a desperate desire for him that had never diminished over the years. Not only did I sometimes feel inadequate next to him, I was madly in love.

To my continual misery, it was a one-sided attraction. Lex was straight as an arrow, and his frequent escapades with the ladies proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt. I wanted to be one of the women who had shared his bed, watching jealously as they made advances at him. Luckily, Lex seemed completely oblivious to this. Either he ignored my longing gazes, or he was unaware of my attraction. I leaned toward the latter explanation. After all, he was not a clever man.

As I dressed in my work clothes in front of the mirror, I imagined Lex standing behind me. A massive wall of thick muscle covered in smooth, black fur against my back. He’d be taller than the mirror, come to think of it. From this position, I wouldn’t be able to see his handsome face, crowned with a pair of long horns only adding to his imposing masculinity.

Time was ticking, however, and I had to tear myself away from my fantasy. I had a job to perform, and I didn’t want to be late. I adjusted the tie around my neck and grabbed my museum badge, getting ready to leave for work.

The National History Museum was a large, palatial building in the city centre. Museum guests were filtering out of the building as I walked in through the doors and made my way to the employee break room. I was early, and figured I’d spend the time reading some of the magazines that the museum provided us.

Entering the break room, I said a brief hello to Bruce, the brown bear whom I had swapped shifts with. His wife had only recently given birth, and I was only happy to pick up some slack and let him get home to his children. Besides, he had promised to buy me a beer later, and I wasn’t one to say no when free drinks were being passed around.

Finally, the clock struck midnight and I exited the break room. The halls of the museum were utterly devoid of life. Only the occasional hum of the air conditioning and my footsteps against the marble floors pierced the quiet. Having worked there for several years, I knew every piece of art like the back of my hand but seeing it at night was an entirely different experience. The men and women staring out at me from the paintings seemed more alive than ever before, giving my slow walk through the majestic rooms an eerie undertone.

For two hours, I patrolled the galleries of the museum, humming quietly to myself as I kept check for anything out of the ordinary. As I rounded a corner on my way out of the renaissance gallery, I noticed that one of the employee access doors stood open.

That’s odd, I thought as I approached the open door. These passageways were usually kept locked, to prevent any guests from wandering off where they weren’t allowed. I entered the doorway and brought out my flash light, shining a ray of light into the darkness. I saw nothing strange but decided it would be prudent of me to make a pass through the corridor regardless.

This wasn’t a set of rooms I frequented. Working as a custodian I had little to do with the artwork itself, my main responsibility being security. As such, I was less than familiar with the place I found myself in. I had entered the archive wing of the museum, where the historians stored away some of the artwork that wasn’t on display. This particular section of the archive housed the smaller items in the collection, such as jewellery and small sculptures. In addition, it was only intended for less valuable items. Consequently, it was one of the only rooms devoid of security cameras.

I walked slowly through the rows of shelves stacked with historical artefacts, shining my flash light across the room. I found myself paying more attention to the items themselves than looking out for anything strange. Having spent years staring at the same artwork, seeing something new was a pleasant sensation.

Coming to the very back of the room, I noticed a shelf that was conspicuously empty. Dust and cobwebs covered the surfaces, even though the rest of the room was kept meticulously clean. I stepped closer and tried to look for any labels, to discern if there were any items missing or if a shelf had simply been left empty.

Only a small bronze plaque was fixed to the wooden surface at the bottom of the shelf. I shone my flashlight at it and tried to make out the writing.

‘Ring of Will – 201 to 350 A.D.’

No other details were present, but there very clearly was no item to be found that matched the description. I got down on my knees and scanned the floor surrounding the shelf, trying to see if anything had been swept away by an errant janitor. I had no luck, and decided that I would let my boss know that I had noticed an item missing.

That would have to wait, though. I looked at my watch, and noticed I still had 4 more hours to go before the morning crew would arrive and I could go home.

The rest of the night was uneventful. I wandered the halls in solitude, trying to make up mental games to play in my head to pass the time. Eventually, rays of sunlight were poking through the stained-glass windows and I began to make my way to the museum foyer, almost ready to leave.

Once the morning crew arrived, I stepped outside into the morning light, and began to make my way home. I thought about sticking my head in and seeing if Lex was awake once I got home but decided against it. At this early hour, he would likely still be asleep.

Once I got home, I was about ready to collapse in the doorway. I’d never worked a night shift before, and I hadn’t been prepared to stay up for so long. I left my clothes on the floor, deciding that I would wash and fold them properly later, and fell into bed.

In the afternoon, I awoke to the sound of the television being turned on in the living room. An enthusiastic voice spoke loudly, though I couldn’t quite make out the words.

I lay still for a while, staring up at the ceiling. I looked to the side at my nightstand, checking the time. The clock had just struck 12:00, so I hadn’t been asleep for too long. I rose from the bed, grabbing a worn t-shirt from the pile of laundry and throwing it on. Exiting my bedroom, I was greeted by the sight of Lex standing in the kitchen, throwing together a meal for himself.

“Oh, hey Jimmy!” He said, smiling at my tired visage. I cringed inwardly at the nickname. I preferred to be called Jim, but Lex had never really gotten the message. “I’m making an omelette, you want some?”

“Sure,” I said, stifling a yawn as I sat down by the kitchen counter. For all the mental acuity that Lex had been born lacking, he was an excellent chef. Yet another reason I hadn’t asked him to get his own apartment. “Remind me to not accept any more night shifts, it’s boring enough to wander that museum when there are other people around.”

“Any plans today?” Lex asked, cracking an obscene amount of eggs into the frying pan. I knew he was big, but the amount of food he ate was nothing short of staggering.

“No, not really,” I said. While he cooked, I looked toward the living room, noticing that the tv was on but showed only one of the channels that were nothing but advertising. “Something on tv you’re going to watch?”

“Yeah, but there’s something wrong with the remote, it won’t switch channels.” Lex said, shrugging and returning to his cooking.

“Did you check the batteries?” I asked, walking toward the coffee table and picking up the remote. “Because you need to change them from time to time.”

Lex didn’t answer, seemingly preoccupied. Yeah, there’s nothing wrong with it, I thought, pressing a few buttons and finding no issue with switching channels. Has he seriously forgotten how a tv remote works?

I put it out of my mind as I noticed Lex putting down two plates on the kitchen table. A small portion for myself, and a veritable mountain of food for him. I wasted no time in scarfing down the omelette, washing it down with a glass of orange juice.

We made some small talk while we ate. I didn’t pressure him to talk about the contents of the bag I had delivered the day before, but I could nevertheless tell that something was weighing on his mind. Lex put on a good show of being his usual cheerful self, but he wasn’t particularly good at it.

I thought back to the night that Jennifer had thrown him out with little more than the clothes on his back and the few possessions in his pockets. The detestable harpy hadn’t even let him back in the house to pick up his wallet, and he had to walk for an hour in pouring rain to get to my apartment. Only later did I find out that she had also tried to use his credit card for her online shopping, probably banking on the assumption that Lex wouldn’t find out. Having to help him through the process of getting the charges reversed had been tedious to the point of exhaustion, but ultimately, I couldn’t leave him to do it alone.

That night, I had been jolted awake by the doorbell at three ‘o clock in the morning. I answered the door in my underwear, ready to hurl insults at whoever had disturbed my sleep. Finding Lex outside, soaking wet from the rain, had been quite the shock. We sat together for hours that night, mostly him trying to talk through ragged sobs about what had happened. I had ended up calling in sick the next day, simply because I hadn’t been able to sleep a single minute.

To this day, I still don’t know exactly what had happened that night. Lex blamed himself, of course, but I knew he had never really been happy in that relationship. It had just never gotten to the point that I or anyone else had tried to confront him about it.
Thankfully, I think he had begun to see that it wasn’t his fault. Whether he was ready to commit to another relationship, that was another question.

“Are you listening, Jimmy?” Lex said, waving a large hand in my face. I was jolted back into reality, evidently having spaced out for several minutes. “You look tired, sure it’s a good idea to take night shifts?”

“Sorry, I just got lost in thought,” I responded, leaning back in my chair. “I don’t think I’ll be taking any more, no. I don’t want to mess up my sleep schedule.”

“Like I was saying, I met this girl at the gym two days ago,” Lex said, smiling at me. I did my best to feign an interest, and to my luck, the bad acting went unnoticed. For obvious reasons, I had difficulty listening to my secret love interest talking about meeting other people. At the very least I was glad for his sake that he was getting more outgoing. “We really hit it off, but she didn’t want to go back to her place, which made it difficult…”

“You’re allowed to bring people here,” I said through gritted teeth. I couldn’t stand the thought of Lex bringing over some girl and having them make out on the couch, or worse. Then again, I couldn’t exactly forbid it either, this was his home as much as mine at this point. “I’m not your dad, Lex. If you want to have someone over, don’t mind me.”

I ended the conversation quickly after that, not wanting to further discuss Lex’s private exploits. He offered to take care of the dishes, and I happily agreed. I walked off to the bathroom, preparing to take a shower. As soon as I had closed the door behind me, I quietly cursed my luck.

Nothing I did made my life easier, it seemed. Soon, I’d surely have to put up with a stream of women wandering in at all hours, drawn by the promise of a randy bull who could treat them to the time of their lives.

I put the thought out of my mind as I showered, trying my best to create a sanctuary from my anguish as the water flowed over my body. It didn’t last long, however. The hot water was soon running out and I stepped out and dried myself.

When coming out of the bathroom, I noticed the pile of work clothes I’d left on the floor before I went to sleep. After dressing myself, I picked up the clothes and went to throw them in the washing machine. When I inspected the pockets to make sure they were empty, I noticed something I didn’t recognise.

Sticking my hand down the pocket, I felt a touch of cold metal. I grabbed hold of the object, assuming it was a coin I’d forgotten about, and emptied it onto the bathroom counter. A chunk of polished metal clanged against the porcelain, along with a piece of folded paper that fluttered out shortly after it.

I stood in silence for a moment, looking at the object that had just fallen out. A ring.

Where the hell did this come from? I thought, picking the ring up and turning it over in my hand. It was perfectly polished, the silvery surface glittering in the light. A small, green stone adorned one side, but other than that it was entirely devoid of features.

I put it down and picked up the paper that had fallen out along with it. It was a paragraph of text, printed on thick drawing paper.

‘*Ring of Will – 201 to 350 A.D.*

*Discovery location: Archaeological excavation following tunnel project at New Garland airport.*

*The specimen conforms to descriptions of ritual jewellery used in ancient times by priests and rulers to enforce their will on others. According to carved tablets discovered alongside the ring, a person merely wears the ring and others will carry out their wishes.*

*Acquired by the Museum of National History from a private collector.*’

“But I never took anything…” I said quietly to myself. The paper stated that the ring belonged to the museum, but I would never steal anything from my place of work. So how did it end up in my pocket? And what was this thing anyway?

I stood for a long time, just looking at the ring sitting in the palm of my hand. It was beautiful. The simple, polished surface along with the precious stone caught the light in an entrancing way, beckoning me to just keep watching it. I need to return this, I thought to myself, putting the ring down on the bathroom counter and continuing my business of loading the washing machine. And yet I didn’t do that at all.

As I exited the bathroom, I stopped suddenly in the doorway and looked down at my hand. There it was. The band of metal on my finger. I still held the piece of paper in my hand, and I looked at it again. Wear the ring and others will carry out their wishes, I recited in my head.

That was impossible. A piece of jewellery couldn’t confer any special powers onto a person more than anything else could. Nevertheless, the ring looked so good on my finger. For an object that had allegedly been made for someone powerful and mighty, it fit perfectly on my ordinary hand.

Wear the ring and others will carry out your wishes.

From the other room, I could hear the television blaring. Frantic voices spoke in high tones, names and numbers flying by as the commenters described an event currently unfolding.

Wear the ring and he will carry out your wishes.

I walked slowly to the door, my mind focusing in on the tantalising possibility that what I had in my possession actually worked the way it alleged. And could there be a better way to try it out than to attempt to finally pick the forbidden fruit that had dangled before me for all these years?

Maybe it works, I thought as I stood in the doorway. Before me, Lex sat in the sofa watching a game of football, his massive body sprawled out with his back turned to me. I approached slowly from behind, nervously fidgeting with the ring on my finger.

“It’s pretty warm in here, isn’t it?” I said, my voice shaking lightly.

“Yeah, I guess.” Lex said, still watching the tv.

“Maybe you’d feel better if you took off your shirt, Lex.” I said, holding my breath. For a moment, the bull did nothing, and I was struck with panic thinking that the ring hadn’t worked. But then, a few seconds later, he stood up and began to unbutton his shirt. I watched in awe as he undressed before me, completely oblivious that I had just given him a rather strange suggestion.

My mind was racing. The possibilities that now lay open before me were nothing short of fantastical. How do I continue? I thought, staring at the bull as he sat back down on the couch, his musclebound upper body completely exposed.

This was beyond unethical. I was contemplating taking advantage of my friend, someone I loved. My conscience, however, was utterly silent. The only urge in my mind was to keep going.

I walked up closer, standing just behind him. Lex was still consumed by the game, paying no mind to my heavy breathing. I decided I would start slow, to find out if there were any limits to the ring’s powers.

“Hey Lex, you don’t mind me getting close to you.” I said, sitting down next to him on the sofa. I shifted ever closer to his warm body, my side pressing up against his enormous frame. Lex didn’t blink, even though I was sitting far closer than a friend normally would. I decided to push my luck just a bit further and laid a hand against his thigh, slowly running my hand over the denim-covered muscle.

The big bull grunted in frustration as the tv showed one team skilfully slip the ball past the goalie, and leaned back into the couch cushions. He scratched his meaty chest with one hand, then laid his thick arm across the couch, pulling me closer to him without thinking about it.

Already, this was a wondrous sensation. Being this close to my childhood friend and forbidden crush had been a dream of mine for years. As I breathed in, I felt his heavy scent saturate the air around us. Telling him to take off his shirt had provided me with more than just a piece of eye candy. I have to have more, I thought, my mouth salivating as my hand rested against Lex’s thick thigh.

“I think it’s still pretty warm in here,” I said, looking up at Lex’s face. He tilted his head, looking down at me and then returning to his game. “It’s just the two of us here, you don’t really want to sit here in all these clothes.”

“I gotta get out of these pants,” Lex said as my not-so-subtle suggestion took hold in his head. He stood up and unbuttoned his jeans, letting the denim fabric fall to the floor. “You just need to let it breathe sometimes, ya know?” He laughed and sat back down beside me, laying his arm around my shoulders once again.

I was this close to just shooting in my pants at this point. My bull friend sat with his legs spread, the only thing separating his staggering package from my hungry glances was a thin sheet of red cloth. I sat in stunned silence, my eyes squarely on the massive prize between his legs. I’d only seen him naked once before, and the image was burned onto my retinas since. Being this close was nothing short of torturous.

“Since we’re such good friends,” I began, my voice dripping with arousal. “You’re ok with me touching you how I want.” I breathed heavily, imagining what I’d be able to do.

“Wouldn’t that be… Strange?” Lex said slowly, evidently experiencing an inner conflict with my lewd suggestions.

“Not at all,” I reassured him, meeting his eyes and smiling at him. “A big guy like you enjoys it when people touch you. It’s a compliment, after all!”

“Oh, I hadn’t thought of that…” Lex said, smiling back at me. “You’re such a nice friend to compliment me like that, Jimmy.”

“What are friends for?” I whispered forth, barely able to contain my mounting arousal. I decided to start slow, letting one of my hands run across his belly, feeling the powerful muscles concealed behind a layer of black fur and fat. I was in awe at his massive bulk, silently trying to comprehend how much bigger he was than me. Lex relaxed into the sofa while my hands explored his body, making sure I left no patch of his body untouched. Despite already taking so much of what I had coveted for years, I wanted more. I wanted every part of him to be mine.

I leaned into his body, resting my head against his chest as my hands caressed his massive legs. Before me, the slumbering beast that was his manhood lay ripe for the picking. I wanted to wait until I got to that part, though. I figured taking the step of actually touching him in that way would require some more conditioning. Testing the waters, I opened my mouth and ran my tongue over one of Lex’s nipples. He moaned at the sensual contact but made no indication that he minded. Emboldened by his response, I took the nub of black flesh into my mouth, suckling on the now-engorged nipple. Lex groaned deeply, emitting a continuous rumbling noise from deep in his belly as I pleasured him.

It was a deeply surreal situation I had found myself in. My hands were lewdly groping his meaty pectorals while I let my mouth taste his magnificent flesh. Through it all, Lex remained focused on the television. Only occasional groans and the sound of heavy breathing gave away that anything was happening. After exploring his chest for more than ten minutes, I decided to move on. His arm was still thrown over my shoulders, exposing his armpit and causing waves of his manly scent to fill the air. I drew a heavy breath and moved my head closer, shivering as his smell filled my lungs.

With every breath, my arousal grew further. I buried my face in his armpit, hungrily breathing in his musk. I still couldn’t believe what was happening, and Lex’s scent overpowering my senses did little to still my sense of wonder and amazement. My perfect bull was mine to do what I pleased with, and I was only getting started. I ran my tongue through the damp fur in his armpit, coating my mouth with his essence. The experience was the closest I had ever come to a divine revelation. In my eyes, Lex had the body of a god, and I was reverently worshipping him.

Finally, I had tasted every part of his armpit, my head swimming with his powerful scent. I pulled back for a moment, breathing heavily while I tried to get my drunk mind to decide the next course of action.

Lex still sat completely unfazed, only occasionally looking at me and smiling as my hands lingered on different parts of his bulky frame. Ultimately, I decided I couldn’t wait any longer. I had to feel the only remaining part of his body.

“Lex, since we’re such close friends,” I began, my hands alternating between groping his thick chest muscles and squeezing his massive biceps. “You think it’s nice when I touch your dick,” My eyes were focused squarely on the red briefs covering his manhood. “In fact, you don’t mind at all when I touch your cock however I want.”

This suggestion was a bit risky. What if I took it too far and accidentally made the giant bull force himself on me? I lucked out, however. Lex didn’t respond with more than a grunt and letting one of his strong hands idly grope at his own clothed package.

The moment of truth, I thought. At first, I couldn’t quite decide how to proceed. This was a near-religious experience for me. Finally, I was about to get access to that which had been out of reach my entire life. At last, I decided only one position was appropriate: on my knees in front of Lex.

I could scarcely breathe as I slid down to my knees in front of him. From this position, he was looking more and more imposing by the second. The fact that Lex was almost completely uninterested in my actions only added to the surreal, yet highly arousing aspect of the situation. My hands were shaking as I slowly reached out toward the massive bulge of meat between Lex’s thighs. Taking a deep breath, I laid my palm against the fabric of his briefs. Beyond the thin cover, I felt an immense warmth, and a powerful tube of flesh coiled over an enormous pair of bull testes.

Lex said nothing as my hands played over his package. He remained focused on the game in front of him, while I was so painfully aroused I could hardly form a coherent sentence. I hooked my fingers under the waistband of his briefs and began to pull down the small undergarment. Gradually, I uncovered what I had been lusting after for so long. I was close to crying with joy as Lex’s full package was laid bare in front of me. I had never seen someone so complete. From this vantage point, every single part of his body combined to form the most perfect male specimen I had even seen.

I had to use both hands to lift Lex’s bull dick and hold it upright. Looking at his immense bulk, my old feelings of inadequacy were nothing but confirmed, but it didn’t matter to me. He was mine now. I began to slowly stroke his cock, watching as the slumbering beast gradually awoke. Lex groaned in pleasure as I jerked his massive dick, briefly closing his eyes and breathing heavily as my hands manipulated his flesh.

My mouth was open in awe as I slowly moved the skin up and down his dick. Despite having known him for years, I’d only seen him naked once, and then very briefly. I’d known he was well endowed, but he was leagues ahead of any other man I’d been with. I guessed that most of it came with the territory of being a bull, but our obvious physical differences made it all the more pronounced.

To my knowledge, Lex hadn’t gotten laid at all since his breakup, which explained why his mammoth dick was fully hard within seconds of my hands touching him. I let go of his member and watched as the pole of flesh twitched and pulsed, struggling to stay upright under its own weight. Focusing on another target of my fascination, I let my hands wander down to touch the enormous pair of bull nuts resting against the sofa cushion.

The heat that radiated from Lex’s massive bull balls was nothing short of astounding. At first it felt like I would singe my hands by simply getting close, but once I had laid both my hands on his package it only added to the attraction. I tried in vain to lift his entire package with one hand, but I wasn’t even close to fitting both of his balls in my hand. Lex grunted in pleasure as I rolled the twin orbs around in my hands, gently squeezing and caressing the soft skin. Eventually, I couldn’t help myself and shuffled closer on my knees. I had to taste him.

I bent forward and laid my entire face against Lex’s massive nuts. As I breathed in, I shivered in pleasure as the damp, heavy air filled my lungs. It was much like a concentrated dose of Viagra and energy drink in one shot. I felt the hairs on my body stand up stiff as I ran my tongue over his silky-smooth balls. My hands simultaneously ran up and down his thighs, appreciating the contrast between the layer of fur on his body and the naked skin on his most private parts.

Once I was satisfied that every nook of his glorious balls had been touched by my tongue, I pulled back, breathing heavily. My eyes could barely focus. The experience of finally realising my deepest desire, combined with the heavy male musk addling my senses left me struck dumb.

I sat back and watched Lex in front of me. His eyes were still fixed on the television, although he was breathing heavily. My eyes wandered down and fixed on my current goal. His engorged bull dick stood straight up, continuously pulsing as droplets of crystal clear precum leaked from the bulbous head. I grabbed the thick shaft with both hands and angled it down, taking a moment to fully appreciate the immense feeling of raw masculinity that radiated from his powerful member.

I had to stand up slightly on my knees to be able to reach, but I finally laid my mouth against Lex’s enormous cockhead. Instantly, I swirled my tongue around the circumference of his shaft, trying to scoop up as much of his plentiful preseed as possible. If I had felt overpowered by his taste and scent before, this was just as powerful a sensation.

Lex tasted just as I had imagined. Sweet as syrup, but with an undeniable masculine musk that filled my mouth with flavour. For several minutes, I simply sat with my lips pursed against the very tip of the massive bull cock, slowly jerking it with my hands and greedily drinking up the trickle of precum that ran forth. With my mouth completely filled with the thick fluid, I swallowed it all down in one gulp, moaning in unreal pleasure as Lex’s wonderful fluids ran down my throat, sating the hunger I’d felt for so long.

Once I’d swallowed down the thick gulp of precum, I stretched my mouth as wide as I could, and tried to fit Lex’s entire cockhead in my mouth. To no avail. I need some practice, I greedily thought as I resigned myself to licking up and down the thick, veiny shaft.

I could tell that Lex wouldn’t last long in his present state, so I had to make the most of it. My own dick was painfully hard in my trousers, but I couldn’t bear to touch myself. I was simply too occupied giving Lex all my attention.

Using both my hands, I slowly jerked his gargantuan dick, my fingers playing over every vein and bump along the meaty shaft. My mouth was firmly planted on the head, running my tongue relentlessly across the sensitive skin. Finally, I could tell that Lex was rapidly approaching his climax, and I redoubled my efforts, rapidly using one hand to stroke his cock while the other caressed his balls.

With a heavy moan that built for several seconds, I felt Lex’s cock twitch powerfully in my hands, and a massive orgasm washed over the bull. Despite having been prepared, the slippery bull dick slipped out of my hand just as the first shot of seed fired from his massive member. I barely managed to close my eyes as my face was instantly coated in warm, thick cum, and I frantically tried to plant my mouth on Lex’s cock again, desperate in my need to taste his seed.

Just as I succeeded, my mouth was filled to the brim with scalding hot bull cum, and I hungrily swallowed it down. As soon as I was done, another river of his fertile essence was fed to me again, and I had to repeat the process once more. For well over a minute, I was too occupied to even breathe as I drank heavily from his cock. I’d never anticipated this much, but I didn’t mind. In fact, this was nothing short of a snapshot from my wildest dreams. Being able to drink my fill from Lex’s godly cock was just one of the most desperate desires I’d harboured in my life.

Finally, his orgasm subsided, and I was left suckling on his hard cock. Occasionally, Lex’s cock would twitch and another fat dollop of seed would fill my mouth, which I swallowed down without a thought. It felt like I had drunk from a fire hose, my belly filled to capacity with his seed. If I’d known this was going to happen, I’d have said no to breakfast.

With a ragged gasp, I let go of Lex’s cock. The massive bull was panting heavily, his body drenched in sweat. Despite his obvious physical exertion, he was still just as unfazed as before. It was like nothing had happened at all. I remained on my knees in front of him, staring intently as his dick fell back against his stomach, still pulsing in his post-orgasm haze.

I felt so fucking good. I closed my eyes and ran my tongue through my mouth, savouring the last few drops of bull cum left, before swallowing it down, joining it with the rest of his massive load swirling around in my stomach. In my reverie, I hadn’t even noticed that I had come at the same time as him. My trousers were soaked with sweat and my own seed.

I stood up slowly, steadying myself against the sofa to help my shaky legs find footing. I walked gingerly out of the living room, leaving Lex sitting naked on the sofa, still watching the tv without a care in the world. As I entered the bathroom, I regarded myself in the mirror. My face shone with sweat, heavy streaks of white seed clinging to my skin and hair. I looked like I had just been aggressively skullfucked, though I had been the only one actively participating.

I removed my clothes and quickly washed myself in the sink, trying to remove some of the bodily fluids sticking to me. What do I do now? I thought, staring into my own eyes. Now that the worst of my lust had subsided, I did feel a pang of bad conscience. Hadn’t I just sexually assaulted my friend? He may not have minded, but that was only because I had ordered him not to.

Despite my unease at the situation, I couldn’t bring myself to regret my actions. The only thought on my mind was how to proceed with the possibilities now open to me. As erotic as it had felt to service Lex while he paid me no mind, that was not what I had always wanted. I wanted him, not just his body, glorious as it was. Luckily, I was able to accomplish this. I stared down at the ring on my finger, wheels turning in my head as I tried to figure out how to make my dreams come true.

Ten minutes later, I sat down with my laptop and created a blank text document. I’d always imagined how I’d respond if I was granted a wish by a genie. Methodically composing the perfect wish, or in this case a set of orders, seemed the optimal way to proceed. For well over an hour I typed away at the keyboard, creating a layered weave of orders that would perfectly condition my subject.

Heartless as it may seem, I didn’t only aim to make Lex mine. I held the power to make him a mindless slave, but what would be the point of that? I wanted to hold him in my arms, to sleep next to him at night. Forcing him into servitude would be as much a wasted opportunity as it would be a tragic fate to impose on someone I loved. I wasn’t about to ask his consent, but I wanted to make him happy. Lex had been miserable when he dated Jennifer, wasn’t this a much better life for him? At least, that’s what I convinced myself.

Once I had finished writing, I stared at a page filled with text. I had crafted an intricate set of suggestions and orders. I made sure not to issue any orders that were too general in scope, focusing instead on creating conditions and specific guidelines. By the end of it, I hoped, I would’ve made Lex love me.

I hit the print button and waited while my printer whirred to life, eventually spitting out the finished paper. Clutching it in my hand, I walked back into the living room. I knew that Lex would listen and take in what I was saying, but I wanted to do this without him staring dumbly at the tv.

“Could you come over here and help me with something?” I said, sitting down by the kitchen table with the paper in hand. Lex nodded and rose from the couch, still clad in only a pair of tight briefs. “Just sit down where you want, I need to read something to you.” He did as I asked and sat down in front of me. Taking a deep breath, I stared into his eyes and began to recite what I had written.

I spoke for several minutes, slowly working my way through the paper. Lex didn’t say anything in response, although there was sometimes a conflicted look in his eyes that quickly went away.
The orders I gave went over practically every aspect of a relationship. I carefully instructed him to rewire his sexuality, setting myself up as his ideal other half. It wasn’t right, I knew that well enough, but I couldn’t stop now that I was so far into it.

Although I was irrevocably changing my friend, I didn’t want to alter his personality. I wanted to discover for myself how he would be as my lover, not create someone who conformed to my own specifications. Besides, Lex already did that without my conditioning.
I finished off with a simple sentence to cover my own tracks.

“You know that this is always the way it’s been.” I said, my voice shaking slightly. For a moment, I stared at Lex in silence. He did nothing. Oh god, I thought. Did I do something to screw him up?

“Weren’t you going to read something, Jimmy?” Lex said suddenly, blinking in apparent confusion. “Jimmy?” He asked again, looking at me with concern before I composed myself.

“Actually, I’ll do that later.” I said, standing up from the chair. Now I had only to test if the message had gotten through properly. At least, that’s what I would have done if Lex hadn’t beaten me to the punch.

I had never imagined that a person of his size could move as quickly as he did. Within a fraction of a second, he had stood up from his chair and crossed the distance between us. My entire body went cold. This is it, I thought. This was to be the moment where my best friend exacted payment from me for my crimes. I closed my eyes, imagining his clenched fist striking my jaw.

That did not happen. Instead, I felt a pair of arms encircle my body in a tight embrace. When I opened my eyes, I saw Lex’s kind face smiling down at me. Slowly, he bent down, and our faces touched. I was dumbfounded. I stood utterly slack-jawed as Lex kissed me. Our differing anatomies made it feel awkward at first, but a few seconds later, it was like a lightbulb turned on in my head.

Ravenously, I kissed him back. I tilted my head to get better access, and willingly let his large tongue into my mouth. My eyes fluttered shut as I melted into the bull’s strong arms. As friends, Lex had always seemed content to let me take charge and make decisions that involved the two of us. In this new position, however, I was surprised at how assertive he was. I tried unsuccessfully to kiss him like I had other men, but I quickly found that he gave me no quarter. I found myself simply hanging on for the ride, weakly allowing him to dominate my mouth and throat with his much bigger tongue.

When he finally pulled away from me to let me draw my breath once again, I silently looked up at his grinning face. He’s so fucking handsome, I thought, admiring his ravishing features. His big, dark eyes stared unrelentingly into mine, keeping me transfixed in his gaze. Staring up at him like this, with his powerful pair of horns crowning his head, it seemed almost like I was caught in the snare of a powerful demon.

“I love you.” I said, my voice barely holding together as I uttered those fateful three words. How long had I not wanted to say that? How many nights had I spent staring up at the ceiling, wondering what it would be like to feel Lex’s arms around me, holding me as I fell asleep?

“I love you too, Jimmy.” Lex said, his strong hands caressing my back as we stood together. It was all I could do not to cry for joy. I laid my head against his broad chest, relishing the feeling of his smooth fur against my skin. I remained that way for a long time, listening to the heavy beating of his heart.

Eventually, the moment had to end. As much as I wanted to remain there forever, we couldn’t simply stand in the kitchen for hours. Lex relaxed his arms around me, and I took a step back, still holding onto one of his hands.

“I have an idea,” Lex said, smiling down at me with a predatory glimmer in his eyes. I looked up into his eyes, holding my breath in anticipation. I didn’t have to wait for long. “Strip for me.”

It wasn’t a request, and I did as Lex told me. Once the last of my clothing had been removed, I stood fully naked in front of him. It was a situation that was as arousing as it was deeply strange. I’d wanted it for so long, yet I couldn’t help but feel like a child in comparison to his enormous body.

“You’re so fucking cute, Jimmy…” Lex said, cupping my cheek in one of his palms. I smiled and broke eye-contact, blushing at the compliment. “Let’s see how cute you’ll be once I’m finished with you.”

Lex laughed quietly as he lifted me into his arms, cradling me like a newlywed bride in her husband’s arms. I did nothing but hang on for the ride. I was his to do with as he pleased, and I intended to let him do what he wanted.

Lying in his arms, Lex carried me to the master bedroom and threw me onto the bed. He motioned for me to lie down on my stomach, and climbed onto the bed shortly afterward.

“You didn’t have any plans today, right?” He said, his hands caressing my naked skin. I shook my head no, shivering at the intimate touch.

“Good.” Lex said, and used both of his hands to almost completely encircle my slim waist, holding me firmly in place. He held me there for a second, and I craned my neck back to look at what he was planning. Evidently, he had waited for me to make eye contact. As soon as I did, he dove forward, instantly planting his face into the crack of my ass.

This had definitely not been part of my mental conditioning regime. I yelped in surprise and pleasure as the bull’s broad tongue made contact with my tightly puckered hole. I loved it when guys ate me out, but it wasn’t something I’d told or even suggested to Lex. This was all him.

I closed my eyes and moaned indiscriminately as Lex went to town on my backside. He was at it like a starving man, breathing heavily as he brutally made out with my ass. I’d never had someone treat me like this before, and Lex hadn’t even penetrated my clenched ring yet. It may have been the emotional weight of the situation, or simply a reaction to the pleasure wracking my body, but not two minutes after Lex had gotten started, I could feel tears forming in my eyes as I buried my face in the pillows.

“How do you taste so good?” Lex growled, pulling back for a second. I looked back at him, my face flushed bright red. With his musclebound body crowned by a pair of large horns, he looked like a vengeful demon. I couldn’t bring myself to answer the question, which seemed to have no effect on Lex. Immediately, he dove back and was back at it.

My breath caught in my throat as he finally penetrated me, and I could feel his thick tongue snaking up inside me, wonderfully pressing against every nerve ending. My mouth fell agape as he pressed hard against my prostate, his long tongue playing my body like a fiddle. Just a moment later, I moaned out like a bitch in heat as he kept up his relentless assault. I had always thought of Lex as a gentle giant, but the way he utterly dominated me revealed an entirely new facet of his personality.

Lex kept me in tortured pleasure for well over twenty minutes, unrelentingly spearing my sensitive ass on his thick tongue. By the end, I was a moaning, sweaty mess. It felt like he had drilled a deep, yawning chasm into my backside. Despite the exhausting aspect of it all, I couldn’t wait to get more. My man was only happy to oblige, but he had conditions.

“Tell me what you want, babe.” Lex said as he let go of my hips, my body slumping against the bed. He moved to position his gargantuan cock against my ass, suggestively rubbing his hot flesh against me.

“Lex, please…” I panted, feeling unable to form more complex words.

“Is that all your sweet mouth can do?” Lex growled, kneading the mounds of my ass in his large hands. “Tell me what you want. I want to hear you say it properly!” He slapped my ass, leaving a bright red mark of his hand.

“Fuck me, please!” I moaned out, clutching the bedsheets in my hands.

“You can do better, Jimmy!” He slapped my ass again, letting the stinging pain motivate me.

“Take me, Lex!” I yelled out, tears forming in my eyes at the exertion. “Spear me on your cock, make me yours!”
Like a cheap whore, I begged for his cock. I used every lewd expression in my vocabulary, my voice growing hoarse as I desperately pleaded for him to fuck me, to punish me, to make me submit to him.

“Shh,” Lex finally said, running a soothing hand through my hair. Tears flowed freely from my eyes. Every second of my life had led up to this one moment, it was too much for me to bear to have him tease me like this.

“I’ll give you everything you want.”

Lex pulled back to align his cockhead with my hole, taking a moment to slather his heavy spear with the thick precum that was flowing from his dick. In a single, determined motion, he drove forward slowly. My ass popped open without much resistance, having been thoroughly loosened before.

Like a tidal wave crashing onto the shoreline, I came as soon as Lex’s awesome bull member pressed against my prostate. Entire constellations of stars washed over my vision, my ragged moans penetrated only by the heavy breathing of the massive man behind me. I hadn’t touched myself even once, and neither had Lex. It seemed as if he did it effortlessly, judging by the scornful snickering he let out as soon as his pelvis pressed against my butt.

“Already?” He leaned down, his mouth mere centimetres from my ear. “Don’t worry, it won’t be your first.”

With those words, he pulled his cock out of my ass, and began the slow travel inside again. I couldn’t tell if he was going so slowly to preserve himself, or to keep teasing me, but it worked regardless. Almost as soon as one mind-blowing orgasm had ended, my dick stood at attention again.

Once his cock was fully inside me once again, Lex slowly laid his body onto mine, pressing my back against his furred chest. Thankfully, he didn’t rest his full weight onto me, or he may have crushed me, but the heavy presence left no doubt that he was taking charge.

Using one of his hands, he tilted my head upward and craned his neck down so that our lips could meet. Like before, the kiss was tender but firmly dominant. I’d never considered that his tongue was so much longer than mine, but he used it to great effect, filling my mouth entirely and snaking the agile limb down my throat, effectively fucking me from both sides at the same time.

That was when he picked up the pace. The bed rocked slowly as he gyrated his hips to drive his fat cock in and out of my once tight hole. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t even moan in pleasure as his tongue completely plugged my mouth. I was completely at his mercy as he fucked me, using his strong body to take me to heights of pleasure I’d never known existed.

It didn’t take long for Lex’s massive member to drive my body to the edge once again. I could only breathe heavily through my nose as Lex fucked another orgasm from my body, my much smaller dick twitching against the bedsheets. The massive bull above me paid it no mind as my body writhed underneath him, simply keeping up the steady pace at which he forced his cock into me.

Compared to before, his stamina was nothing short of extraordinary this time. Determinedly, he pressed my body into the mattress, each stroke of his cock delivering waves of pleasure onto my hapless body. I could only hang on for the ride. Lex kept me mute with his thick tongue owning my mouth as his enormous frame ground every ounce of self-esteem I’d ever held into dust. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t think. I could barely move as he kept me pinned underneath him, his strong body keeping me completely immobile.

I may have created this scenario, but I had no idea that I’d sign away myself this way.

Still, I couldn’t complain. All those times I’d felt small and weak? They may have been confirmed to an extent I didn’t know possible, but what I had received in return was a fevered wet dream come true.

By now, I could tell that Lex had grown tired of his game of trying to force as many orgasms from my tiny body as he could. He’d succeeded in his endeavour three more times, leaving me completely limp in his arms. I may have been ready to stop, but he was far from done with me.

Without missing a beat, he wrapped his massive arms around me and used his legs to spread my thighs apart, giving him unfettered access to my body. In a show of force, he slammed into me. I took a sharp breath as I felt his heavy balls slap against my much smaller ones, delivering a jab of pain that only added to my feeling of utter submission to him.

He kept up this exact rhythm, forcing his goliath cock into my twitching hole with greater and greater force, until I could feel his muscles tense around me in anticipation of his roaring climax.

Like a triumphant animal, Lex shoved his cock all the way into me one last time. His arms gripped me even tighter, forcing every bit of air from my lungs as I felt the first wave of heat spill into me. He finally pulled his mouth from mine and screamed out his orgasm. I was held against him still, having no choice in whether to take his seed or not. As the river of thick cum poured forth into me, rapidly filling me with warmth, I felt heavy drops begin to leak around his cock, the volume too great for me to accept.

For the last part of his climax, Lex released my body from his constricting arms, and I could breathe properly again. Not that the reprieve made any difference, the steady presence of his heavy body against mine made any semblance of escape impossible. He had utterly fucked the resistance from me.

As he finished inside me, Lex rolled us onto our sides, still keeping his engorged cock inside me. We both panted in tandem. I could feel heavy drops of sweat clinging to both our bodies, saturating the air with a heavy smell of sex, overpowered by Lex’s thick scent.

“Fuck.” Lex said. The one word encapsulated most of what was to be said. I felt thoroughly destroyed, yet wonderfully released at the same time. This day had taken on a distinct theme of conflicting feelings.

“How was that?” He continued, running a hand down my stomach, feeling the sticky seed clinging to my skin from my many orgasms.

“Uh,” I began, seemingly unable to form a coherent response. I blinked and tried to regain my senses. “It was amazing.” I finally replied, sighing heavily as I rested my head against Lex’s cannonball bicep.

“Oh yeah?” He said. I could detect the smirk in his voice without having to see it for myself. To an extent, it alarmed me. After this ordeal, could I handle more?
“I’m not done yet, but a little guy like you need some time to recharge, I think.”

His prediction came true. We lay together for a long time, building the energy to get up and shower together. Our second time was slower, more tender. Lex slowly worked me up and down his member as I sat in his lap, occasionally pulling myself up and down by his horns, a fantasy I’d long entertained.

As the day came to an end, we retired together to my bedroom. I made a mental note to buy a bigger bed, now that we finally shared one. As I rested against his chest, I spent an hour simply running my hands through his soft fur as we talked. I’d discovered a new side of him, but the old Lex that I loved was still there.

“I’m looking forward to tomorrow.” I said as I slipped the ring off my finger and gingerly laid it on my nightstand. I didn’t know that I would use it again, but it’s power had brought a happiness I’d never known before.


I awoke much like I had fallen asleep, feeling Lex’s arms around me, holding me tight against his larger frame. I could barely move an inch like this, but I didn’t really mind. For the briefest of moments, I thought that I was still dreaming, but as the memories from the past day came crashing onto me, I realised that it was all real.

I sighed in contentment, enjoying the feeling of being held by the love of my life. As the drowsiness of sleep gradually left my body, I cast a look at my alarm clock. It was only a few minutes past 7 in the morning. I had anticipated needing more sleep, but evidently I could handle more than I thought.

As I lazily looked around the room, I noticed something was amiss. On the nightstand, just beside the base of the lamp, there was nothing. Absolutely nothing. The ring was gone.

Icy cold panic gripped my body. The very thing that had enabled this situation to occur in the first place had vanished. It wasn’t so much the possibility of losing control that I feared, but what if the changes I had made would come undone? What would Lex say if he found himself in my bed, having no idea why he was currently clutching his friend to his chest?

Slowly, I tried to extract myself from his arms. I didn’t want to wake him up, but luckily he appeared to be a heavy sleeper. When finally I had wiggled myself free, I stood beside the bed and stared intently at the spot where I had placed the ring. That failing, I bent down to look around on the floor, my eyes intently spying for any sign of gleaming metal against the hardwood floor. Nothing.

I stood up, bewildered at how this could have happened. I frantically searched my mind, considering the possibility that I might have misplaced the ring myself, but I came up empty-handed. My train of thought was interrupted by the sound of crisp bedsheets moving on top of someone. I looked toward my side and saw Lex open his eyes and look at me.

“Hey, Lex.” I said, bracing myself for disaster.

“Hey babe,” Came his answer. I looked at him in disbelief. It still works? I thought, looking around the room to see if I could find the ring once again. “Why are you up so early? Come back to bed.”

And I did. As much as I wanted to find the ring again, I couldn’t rightly refuse that request. I tried to put it out of my mind as best as I could, focusing instead on snuggling up as close as possible to my bull lover.

We stayed in bed for several more hours, making occasional small talk with each other. When we finally rose, Lex went to pick up our clothes, still discarded on the floor, while I got breakfast ready. A while later, I stood in front of the fridge as Lex walked into the kitchen, idly scratching at his left hand. And that’s when I saw it again.

“That ring…” I began, looking wide-eyed as Lex slipped the metal band onto one of his fingers. Fuck, I thought as the bull yawned, then looked with disinterest at his hand. How the hell did it fit on his fingers? It had been so snug on my small hands; how could this behemoth possibly wear it?

“This thing? It’s just an ordinary ring, Jimmy. I found it in one of my pockets.” Lex said, sitting down by the kitchen table.

I blinked slowly. Ordinary? It was ordinary, it didn’t even look particularly good. In fact, it looked kind of cheap. Why had I asked about it?

“Not sure I really like it, actually. I won’t keep it,” Lex said, taking the ring from his finger and tossing it into the garbage bin. It landed softly among the discarded rubbish and was swiftly covered up by cracked egg shells and an empty carton of orange juice. “Are you okay? You looked a bit worked up.”

“I’m fine,” I said, smiling at Lex as I produced two plates of fried eggs. “Just a bit tired.”

I vaguely recalled feeling worked up about something, but what? The more I thought about it, what could it even have been?

As I sat down to breakfast with my lover and partner, I couldn’t imagine a more perfect situation than this.
