## Main Characters

### **Franklin Connaught**

Species: Spotted Leopard

Age: 37

Franklin "Frank" Connaught is a divorced private investigator. After failing to resolve a hostage situation, leading to the death of three people, he was terminated from the TK City police department.

He has since worked out of a basement office in TK District with mostly minor cases. When Celine Fontainebleau, widow and heiress, contacts him about the death of her husband, he initially refuses her case, but is later prompted to accept it.


### **Maximilian Barrow**

Species: Siberian Tiger

Age: 35

Max Barrow is the former husband of Frank Connaught. Though long separated, they are on good terms and still meet regularly. After his ex-husbands termination, Max helped him from falling into depression and substance abuse.

Max works as a hotel manager, a position Frank sometimes uses in his work since it affords plenty of opportunity to get close to targets.


### **Leonidas Brunelles**

Species: Lion

Age: 65 - deceased

Leonidas Brunelles is the deceased husband of Celine Brunelles. Marrying into his wife's rich family, Leonidas soon took over management of much of the family's finances and led them to great success. In his later years, however, his luck began to ran dry. The family racked up large debts and was forced to sell off assets to settle.

Leonidas is found dead one morning (two years ago at story start), and the cause is ruled as heart failure. While Leonidas was under considerable stress, and the diagnosis is not implausible, his widowed wife suspects that his death is not natural.


### **Celine Brunelles**

*NÃ©e Goldberner*

Species: Lion

Age: 67

Celine Brunelles is the widow of Leonidas, and has hired Franklin Connaught to investigate the death of her husband.

Celine had no close involvement in her family's finances, she was focused on her own career as a painter and was content to leave the economical matters to her financier husband. When her husband passes away, she is left with considerable debts to settle.


### **Harold Goldberner**

Species: Lion

Age: 70

Harold Goldberner is the older, estranged brother of Celine Brunelles. Owing to a fight with their since deceased parents, he was disowned and excluded from the will, leaving Celine the sole heiress.

Harold was the editor-in-chief of the *Union Gazette*, one of the city's largest newspapers. He has since retired and lives with his wife.

Harold has a tense relationship with his sister. He believes that he is owed part of the family wealth, but his sister chose to follow their parents' wishes and did not contest the will. Now that the family fortune is dwindling away, he feels both sadness and some amount of spite at the events unfolding.

Harold is initially suspected to be involved in the death of Leonidas Brunelles, but his name is cleared when he provides Franklin with an alibi.
